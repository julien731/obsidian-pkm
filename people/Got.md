## 2025 Performance Review Notes

- Too messy. You need to plan more. Without plans, things always get out of hand. Especially when there is a rush.
    - E.g., JS rollout plan, or lack thereof.
    - E.g., inventory (stock in/out) there was no proper documentation and [I discovered the spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tg_aINW3LlJnc_x-VTEK3jZuCRqUOmR5/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=105159994772364082859&rtpof=true&sd=true) on the 17.
- Too many workarounds. E.g., the payment methods on POS. If no choice, at least document. Otherwise the team is left with unexpected problems.
- You need to organize artifact better. E.g., Notion (many random pages), Metabase dashboard.
    - Overall quality of your deliverables needs to improve.
    - Metabase dashboard was very messy and had lots of discrepancies.
- You allow too much rush. You need to set better boundaries with stakeholders. E.g., T21, 5 more stores deployment.
- You need to better assess the impact of what you do and how to properly plan your actions. Example: https://nimble-co.slack.com/archives/C09RZK3PT60/p1764815248699249
