## Notes

### 2021-09-30 - Individual Onboarding

#### Why we're bringing you onboard

Nimble is a growing company. We are working with more and more clients, and the projects that we lead are increasingly complex. It creates a need for more Product Management power, and this is where you come in: we need more Product Managers to satisfy more clients.

#### What you'll be working on

Given your Junior role, your work will be divided into two major phases:

1. Training
2. Product Ownership
    1. Under Supervision
    2. On Your Own

During the training phase, you will follow some training paths that we have developed internally to promote individuals' growth, and you will have to pass some certifications. Those certifications aren't internal tests; instead, they are external certifications that will help you learn new skills.

During that phase, you will also shadow a more senior Product Manager on the team and progressively start taking on Product Management tasks with increasing complexity.

When reaching the second phase of your journey, you will start taking ownership of a product/project. At first, you will own a product under the supervision of a more senior Product Manager.

As you progress with your Product Management skills, confidence level, and communication abilities, you will start to own products independently.

#### Who you'll need to meet and work with

It is essential that you feel comfortable reaching out to the entire team and feel confident asking for advice or direction from other Product Managers.

More specifically, you will be working with Kamiye during the training phase of your work here.

#### How we'll know if you are successful

There is a lot that goes into becoming a successful Product Manager. Looking at your specific profile and personality, here are the expectations for your success:

- You will have a deep and comprehensive understanding of the Nimble Product Management process within the first month.
- You will be able to report and triage bugs appropriately within the first month.
- You will have passed the AWS Cloud Practitioner certification within the first two months.
- You will understand the fundamental differences between web, iOS, and Android within the first two months.
- You will write clear documents (with good English writing and grammar) within the first three months.
- You will be able to write clear and actionable user stories within the first three months.

#### How we'll keep you (and ourselves) accountable

The success criteria might look challenging (and I hope it does, a challenge is good!) but remember: you're not alone.

You will have weekly 1-on-1 sessions with the CPO and plenty of opportunities to ask questions and seek guidance.

Those 1-on-1 sessions are also the opportunity for *you* to ensure that you get what you need to succeed, whether it is knowledge, guidance, or else.
