## 2025 Performance Review Feedback (by Julien)

### What went well

- He's gotten better at prioritizing quality candidates.
- He seems genuinely open to understanding where/why candidates don't pass.
- He's striking a better balance between selling/pushing candidates and recognizing when they don't work out.

### What could be better

- He needs to develop a deeper understanding of the technical roles (I am happy to help with that, whether it's for Jake or anyone else in TA).
- It would be good for him to get more familiar with the take-home assignments. I don't expect him to be able to assess a candidate's deliverables, but there are times where, if you know what to look for, it's obvious that the submissions are bad.
- He needs to improve his presentation skills. Whenever he presents something, he is speed-running and not delivering insights.
- He needs to figure out how to leverage data and AI to find candidates (e.g., understanding what are the traits of successful hires, trying to find patterns that could reveal high-quality candidate sources, etc). There is support available if he wants to test out some technical solutions, but he needs to come up with ideas.
