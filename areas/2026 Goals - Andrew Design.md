This document captures [[people/Andrew]]'s (Lead Designer at Nimble) input for 2026 team goals. He identifies problems to fix (misalignment before design, passive order-taking, over-reliance on copying competitors) and proposes solutions (Figma Make workflow, three-stage testing, clear career paths, stricter onboarding). For the consolidated analysis across all leaders, see [[areas/2026 Team Goals Analysis]].

## Contributor

[[people/Andrew]] - Lead Designer

## What to Fix

### 1. Misalignment Before Design Starts
- Moving forward before full alignment to save time (e.g., OKYA)
- Costs more time later through rework and corrections
- Need alignment between Leadership, PMs, and Engineering before tickets enter design backlog
- Solution: Simple system to make alignment easier and faster

### 2. Passive Order-Taking from Clients
- Accepting inefficient requests (CBTL, JB) without questions
- Need to demand roadmaps and business context
- Guide clients toward valuable work instead of reacting to sudden changes
- Embrace consultant mindset

### 3. Over-Reliance on Copying Competitors
- Treating competitors like Toast as the only source of truth (e.g., POS)
- Prevents critical thinking and experience optimization
- Degrades team's problem-solving skills

## What to Accomplish

### 1. Adopt Figma Make Workflow
- AI-prompting workflow to instantly visualize ideas with PMs
- Drastically cut time on initial drafts
- More time for refining logic and solutions
- Framework shared during Design Exchange, testing in January
- [Figma Make AI Framework](https://www.notion.so/Figma-Make-AI-Framework-2bc70938b3098064a294fded740fb5b2?pvs=21)

### 2. More Testing at Three Key Stages
1. Early concept validation
2. High-fidelity prototype testing
3. Measuring success after launch

### 3. Clear Career Paths and Goals
- Designers need clear growth paths with measurable milestones
- Know what skills to improve
- Understand how progress is tracked
- Clear next steps for consistent quality delivery

### 4. Stricter Onboarding Roadmap
- Quantifiable plan to track new hires (Milan case)
- Spot performance issues early
- Intervene before problems escalate

## Skills the Team Needs

### 1. AI-Prompting Framework Mastery
- Every designer must become proficient with Figma Make
- Essential for new workflow speed and efficiency

### 2. Strategic Communication
- Learn to ask "why"
- Push back on tasks lacking context
- Shift from "yes" to consultant mindset
- Understand business goals and collaborate on solutions

### 3. Product Thinking
- Move focus from visual polish to product logic
- Understand how solutions function and solve user problems
- Move away from "pixel pushers" to problem solvers
