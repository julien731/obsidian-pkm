This document captures Julien's (CPO) strategic input for Nimble's 2026 team goals. It outlines problems to fix (visibility, QA burden, weak stakeholder relationships, quality degradation, shallow discovery) and goals to accomplish (end-to-end AI workflows, better training, stronger influence). For the consolidated analysis across all leaders, see [[areas/2026 Team Goals Analysis]].

## Contributor

**Julien** (CPO) - High-level strategic direction

## What We Need to Fix

### Visibility & Communication
- Not enough visibility on project status, progress, challenges, and opportunities
- Not providing visibility to key stakeholders on the value we deliver

### QA Burden
- QA is taking too much valuable time from Product Managers

### Stakeholder Relationships
- Weak relationships between PMs and key stakeholders (decision-makers, influencers)
- PMs primarily connected to execution-level Product Owners
- PM skillsets underutilized due to limited scope of relationships

### Quality Standards
- Tight timelines and rush periods in 2025 resulted in lower quality
- Quality is our primary differentiator as a company

### Mentoring & Training
- Not deep enough due to independent PM work
- Few opportunities to observe PM work, especially communication
- Basics (backlog management) can be checked, but soft skills cannot

### Discovery
- Most PMs don't know how to do proper discovery
- Too shallow; lack deep understanding of:
  - Operational workflows
  - Technical constraints
  - Clients' true and unspoken intent

## What We Need to Accomplish

1. End-to-end AI-assisted workflows (sales → pre-sales → design → PM → development → delivery)
2. Restructure project resources to enable AI insights
3. Provide better training to the team
4. Gain more influence through better stakeholder relationships

## Skills to Develop

1. **AI proficiency** - Core competency for 2026
2. **Communication with corporate stakeholders** - Beyond execution-level contacts
3. **Discovery** - Deep understanding before execution
