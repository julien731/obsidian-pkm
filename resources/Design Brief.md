# Design Brief


# Introduction

We have recently purchased a 448 sqm (112 square wah) piece of land in Bang Kobua in the heart of “Bangkok’s green lungs.”

The land is hidden in the green lush of Bang Kobua. It’s a beautiful and peaceful location.

![Untitled](Design%20Brief/Untitled.png)

We’ve wanted to move to the green lungs of Bangkok for some time. We used to rent a house in Bang Kachao a few years ago. We have since moved to On Nut, but we are getting tired of the noise, the pollution, and the lack of greenery of Bangkok city center.

After a long search, we finally landed on this great property where we plan on living full-time with our dog.

# Land Specifications

- Size: 448 sqm (112 square wah)
- Shape: rectangular. One side is slightly longer than the other.

# Building Requirements

<aside>
💡 While we have a pretty good idea of what we want the construction to look like, we want to get feedback from you. We are not experts in architecture, and we are not familiar with construction regulations (especially in Phrapadaeng). Do not hesitate to propose other ideas and to challenge us where we are incorrect.

</aside>

- A house. 2 or 3 stories (I believe the maximum height in the area is 16 meters).
    - Living space around 150—250 sqm.
    - Ideally L-shaped.
    - One master bedroom with a walk-in closet and en-suite bathroom.
    - One guest bedroom with shared bathroom.
    - One half-bathroom on the ground floor.
    - One office/study that comfortably fits two large desks.
    - One (small) laundry room.
        - This is where we would have a laundry machine, and some space to dry and fold the laundry. Having a sink would be a plus.
- Favor the use of natural materials such as wood and stone.
- A swimming pool (we do not expect the swimming pool to be huge).
- A 2-car, closed garage.
- An outdoor sala/lounging area. It could be atop the garage to minimize the footprint on the ground.
- Minimal footprint on the land (we want to maximize garden space). Favor vertical construction.
- Ideally, a rooftop lounging area (if possible, we will still favor a 3rd floor if it is an option).
- Lots of large windows to bring in natural light.
- Ethernet wiring throughout the house.
- The property entrance (gate) should be wide enough to allow access to large vehicles in case we need to bring in trucks for future construction work.

# Architectural Style

In general, we want a modern and minimalist design. We also want to try and blend indoor and outdoor spaces.

## Interior

We want the house design to follow our lifestyle and circulation flow. The house should optimize movement that matches the way we live. We do not want the house to force flows that don’t match our habits and routines.

Nature is also essential to us. We want to house to feel connected to nature.

The house needs to have storage space so as to keep it clean and clutter-free. A closed pantry area is probably something that we need.

### Workflows

Here is what a typical day looks like for us.

1. Wake up early.
2. Quick wash up.
3. Go out to walk the dog.
4. Get back home and do a physical workout.
5. Go for a swim.
6. Shower and get ready for the day.
7. Make tea/coffee and get work started (light work).
8. Go to the office/study for the work day.
9. Lunch break.
10. Back to work.
11. Finish work, go relax outside.
12. Prepare dinner and eat.
13. Relax, watch a movie or read books.

The house design should support this flow.

### No Go

As an example of what we **do not want,** our current house is laid out like so:

- Ground floor: kitchen and living room.
- First floor: master bedroom, bathroom.
- Second floor: guest bedroom, office, bathroom

Based on the workflow described above, our current house adds friction when going to the office area as it is on the last floor, while the master bedroom, where we only go once daily, is on the second floor.

## Exterior

We want a modern, minimalist exterior with strategically placed lighting for a pleasant night experience.

<aside>
💡 Lighting is important to us and should not be an afterthought.

</aside>

The building should use light-color materials and light-color paint to reduce heat absorption.

# Non-Functional Requirements

## Energy Efficiency

With the hot Thai weather, we want the house to be energy efficient to:

1. Keep the house cool
2. Minimize the electricity bills

We are not experts on how to achieve energy efficiency. There are three areas that we are considering:

- Using double-layer walls with heat insulation.
- Using double-glazing windows.
- Using geothermal energy (e.g., [Canadian Well](https://www.ecopassivehouses.com/canadian-wells/)).

## Water & Filtration

- The water main must lead to the reserve tanks. No faucet, including outdoor, should be connected to the water main.
- There must be a filter before the water tanks (filtering the water from the main).
- All water distribution for inside **and** outside must be served by a water pump.

## Water Rooms

- Showers
    - “Hidden” drainage hole
    - Enough length that we can step out of the rain shower flow for cleaning
    - Sloped design so that the water drains without the need for a lower floor height
- Bathtub with a view in the master bedroom (no other bathtubs)
