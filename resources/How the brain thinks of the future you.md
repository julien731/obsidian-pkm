# How the brain thinks of the future you


If I can visualize and connect with my future self, I can get more control over my current self (e.g., behaviors, values, habits). That’s because without a clear vision and emotional connection to the future self, the part of the brain that thinks of the future self is not the same part that “knows” the current self.

In order words, having an emotional and very well defined connection to the future self leads to the brain being able to connect behaviors to the future self and not just the current self.
