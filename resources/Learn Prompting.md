Everything you need to know about our AI courses and learning pathways

### What is the best certification to get for AI?

There is no single "best" certification for AI because it depends on your career goals. If you're looking to prompt engineer AI systems effectively, consider our [ChatGPT & Prompt Engineering Pathway](https://learnprompting.org/courses/chatgpt-prompt-engineering-pathway) for an end-to-end learning experience. Each course in this pathway includes real-world exercises and awards a Certificate of Completion, which can help you demonstrate your AI skills to employers.

### Can I learn AI for free?

Yes, you can. At Learn Prompting, we offer several free ways to get started, including our [ChatGPT for Everyone](https://learnprompting.org/courses/chatgpt-for-everyone) course, a beginner-friendly, one-hour introduction to ChatGPT, one of the leading Generative AI models.

### How do you become AI certified?

Certification typically involves completing a curriculum and passing assessments. With Learn Prompting, you can enroll in multi-course Learning Pathways such as our [ChatGPT & Prompt Engineering Pathway](https://learnprompting.org/courses/chatgpt-prompt-engineering-pathway).
