# How can dogs tell from the tone of your voice that you are demanding with your command? A soft spoken "sit" is ignored but a louder demanding "SIT!" is immediately obeyed.


- Dogs ignore you on purpose when *they* control the situation.
- If they respond when you get angry it's because they know it's your threshold. However, everything that comes before that can be ignored.
- Once they get into the habit, they expect you to repeat the command and don't even budge at first.
- NEVER repeat a command.
