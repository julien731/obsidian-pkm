# Property purchase costs


When buying a property, the following taxes and fees must be paid:

- **2% for the land transfer fee** (this is based on the evaluation price conducted by the Minister of Land)
- **0.5% stamp fee** if the land has been owned by the current owner for 5+ years. If the land has been owned for less than 5 years the stamp fee is 3%.
- **3.3% income tax** for the seller
