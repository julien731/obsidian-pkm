# 40 Times Designers Went All In And Designed The Most Fabulous Examples Of 'Modern Architecture' | Bored Panda


Modernist architecture has the best public relations managers since the name itself evokes notions like “contemporary” or “current,” while brutalism sounds like a metal band struggling to create an adjective. While quite recent, modernism isn’t defined by being “new,” rather, it’s a design philosophy that celebrates experimentation and rejects rules.

The “[Modern Architecture](https://www.facebook.com/groups/3darchitect/)” Facebook group shares exactly what you would think, images of glass and concrete constructions that look like they came straight out of Minecraft. Or Lego, depending on your generation. So scroll through and be sure to upvote your favorites and comment your thoughts on this style.
