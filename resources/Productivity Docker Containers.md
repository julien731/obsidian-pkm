# Productivity Docker Containers

Article exploring how Docker containers can replace SaaS productivity tools with self-hosted alternatives.

## Key Tools Mentioned

### BentoPDF
Privacy-first PDF toolkit with a clean grid-based UI. Handles merging, rotating, editing, and converting PDFs locally without upload delays. Fast even with large files.

### Grocy
Smart household inventory manager. Tracks what you have (not just what to buy), manages expiration dates, handles chore scheduling, and battery tracking.

### Activepieces
Self-hosted automation orchestrator — a Zapier alternative. AI-first with local LLM support. Linear, modern UI (simpler than n8n). No task count limits since it's self-hosted.

### Super Productivity
Deep work command center. More than a to-do list — integrates with GitHub, Jira, etc. Built-in time tracking and Pomodoro. Self-hosted = private task data.

### Invoice Ninja
Professional freelance billing system. Recurring invoices, automation, built-in Kanban for project management. Free alternative to FreshBooks.

## Why Self-Host?
- No subscription fees
- No task/usage limits
- Data privacy
- Customization freedom
