# Hua Hin House Requirements


<aside>
💡 The house does not need to be furnished.

</aside>

## Non-Negotiables

- Large-ish land. 500 sqm+. It must be green (i.e., no concrete everywhere.)
- 170 sqm+ living area.
- (Very) quiet area.
- 3+ bedrooms, 2-3 bathrooms (we need at least one guest room and an office room.)
    - There should be enough space for a walk-in closet (if one doesn’t exist we are open to having it built as long as there is enough space.)
- Open view (no buildings around.)
- Large kitchen area (we’re open to renovating if the kitchen is big but dated.)
- Parking space (for 1 car at least, ideally space for 2.)

## Location

## Open to Offers

- With or without swimming pool. If there is not swimming pool we would build one so we would only consider a house at a lower cost.
- Outside of a mooban but we’d consider something in a mooban if the property is really attractive.
- Outside terrace with shaded space.
- Modern style/construction.
- Location: we are open to other locations than what’s outlined above as long as it remains within roughly a 30-minutes drive from Hua Hin center.

## Budget

Up to 6.5 if little to no renovation work is needed.
