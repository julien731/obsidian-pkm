# Simply Said: Communicating Better at Work and Beyond


> Remember, the client cares less about what you want, and more about why he should want it. Tie every detail you share to a benefit to your client. To figure out the benefits to a client, think about the “universal motivators” of time, feelings, and money.

If you can figure out the benefit to the audience, you will have a better chance of achieving buy-in for your ideas.
