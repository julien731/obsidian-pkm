# No Rules Rules

Cover: https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1575964083l/49195924._SY475_.jpg

1. Increase talent density
    - Continue being strict when hiring
    - Pay top-of-market
    - **Trust people (and their decision-making) or get rid of them**
2. Increase candor
    - Start by asking for more feedback from the team (e.g., during 1-on-1s)
    - Start *giving* more candid feedback *whenever it is necessary*
3. Open the books (no secrets)
4. Empower people (let them make their own decisions)

Product vs service

Innovation vs risk avoidance because money loss is always the risk

Mistakes vs failed bets

Lead with context, not control.
