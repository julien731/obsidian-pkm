### Current Employment Status

- Chief Product Officer at Nimble (10 years total)
    - Started as Head of Product and Business Development
    - Became CPO ~6-7 years ago
    - Original contract includes monthly salary + 5% equity
- Partnership agreement discussion began 3 years ago
    - CEO offered partnership when Julien was considering other opportunities
    - Verbal agreement for 6% common shares
    - No written documentation beyond Slack conversations

### Legal Assessment of Partnership Claim

- Current situation carries significant risk
    - No binding written agreement for share ownership
    - Only informal Slack conversations as evidence
- Enforceability depends on conversation content
    - Binding language like “don’t worry, you will get it” could be useful
    - Screenshot evidence needs professional review for legal weight
- Unlikely to have strong legal recourse without formal documentation

### Recommended Strategy

- Create written evidence trail
    - Draft shareholder agreement or offer letter independently
    - Send to CEO with request to formalize discussions
    - Generate email responses to build documentation
- Risk: Unknown how management will respond to formal approach
- Alternative: Send existing Slack conversations for legal analysis
    - Assess binding nature of current evidence
    - Determine potential legal options

### Current Mindset & Timeline

- Not in urgent situation or planning immediate exit
- Medium-term plans to leave for other ventures
- Still expects proper documentation but patience wearing thin
- Trust in CEO declining after 3-year delay
- Seeking to protect position proactively rather than reactively

### Next Steps

- Review collected evidence (screenshots, conversations)
- Consider sending materials for legal analysis of binding language
- Contact information available for legal consultation if situation escalates
- Hope to resolve through internal processes rather than legal action
