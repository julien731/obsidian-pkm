# Post-Julien Era


# Preface

The objective of this letter is to provide (my) insights about the company's future, the risks that I can foresee, and suggestions of areas to address to reduce those risks.

While some of the contents may seem critical, please be assured that it is solely constructive criticism and that this is in no way a list of complaints or an attack towards the company nor any of you, Carlos, Olivier.

I also want to start this letter by stating that I have an enormous amount of respect for what you two have built, especially considering that you have entirely bootstrapped the company. It is no small feat and the result is an astonishing level of quality and a model of efficiency in the entire region. I deeply believe that Nimble is not playing in the same field as other consultancies in South-East Asia.

I have myself grown professionally and I truly learnt an immense amount of information and skills. Joining Nimble has been a humbling experience. Back in 2016 when I joined I felt like I knew a lot. Arguably, I did. However, I also had a *lot* more to learn and I didn't think at the time that there was so much more.

Today, I feel very confident as a professional and, at the same time, I am keenly aware that there is always something for me to learn with every interaction, every project, and every problem. I have to thank you both for being part of my journey and also for having given me the opportunity to join you these past 5 years. Despite all the comments about what could be better below, I would recommend Nimble to anyone wanting to work in a challenging environment while working alongside a terrific team and operating at the highest-level of productivity and efficiency.

On that note, I believe that you should pursue Carlos' idea of a "Nimble University" to train Engineers should there be a valuable business angle. I think that "trained by Nimble" could become a brand of its own somewhat similar to what "ex-Google" and others mean to people in the industry (although most are becoming irrelevant nowadays imo).

# Carlos Communication Methods

- Too harsh.
- The team fears you.
- Not in public.
- Tremendous amount of knowledge to be passed on but not mentoring people.

# Personal Tensions

- It's visible.
- It impacts the team.
- It impacts the efficiency of the company.
