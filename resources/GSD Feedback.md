# GSD Feedback

Feedback on the [get-shit-done](https://github.com/glittercowboy/get-shit-done) framework — inputs that directly shaped the SNAIPE/Argus design.

## Not Working Well
- I don't like the commits prefix
- Hard to follow Gitflow
	- Lower quality because of that; it's harder to review the code
- No writing tests baked into the workflow
- Although the docs live in the repo, they don't get updated
- When I add new stuff "on the fly" there is 0 tracking of it in any docs

## Working Well
- Research is good
- Planning is good
