# Tanny’s Agoda Interview Feedback


# Present Yourself

- Too chronological. You need to highlight your journey, strengths, and learnings.
- Too many filler words.
    - “Humm”
    - “You know”

# General

- Talk too fast. Take your time.
    - You go so fast that you tend to cut the interviewer off a bit.
- You are saying you won’t be a TTEC too early. The way you said it could be misinterpreted.
- Good that you bring up how your experience can be valuable for the role that they describe.
- Good job on the practical examples.
- Own things more. When you say “at TTEC we needed to measure UPA” it feels like you’re just doing what you’re told.

# Salary

You totally messed it up. wtf. We repeated it. Why did you handle it this way.
