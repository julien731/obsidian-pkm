# Guide to Turning Small Money Into Big Money 💰


"Normal" people like us don't make enough money to live comfortably forever, especially with high ambitions and expensive hobbies.

The only solution, short of winning the lottery or getting a very, very high income, is investing.

Investing can be done in several different ways. This guide focused on two investment strategies: real estate and financial markets.

💡 This guide is based on countless articles, videos, and other resources that I have gone through over time. Some resources are linked in this guide, but not all.

# Financial Markets

Financial markets offer a fantastic opportunity for wealth growth thanks to two things: a consistent upward trend over (a long period of) time and [compound interest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_interest).

## Savings

<aside>
💡 Savings bank accounts aren't exactly "financial market" but because some savings are necessary, and because there *are* better ways to save than others, savings accounts are covered in this section.

Saving up money is, on paper, an honorable effort and a responsible choice. However, saving money in a traditional savings account is expensive because of inflation.

The interest rates offered by most banks are terribly low and, more often than not, lower than the inflation rate. This results in a direct financial loss over time.

There are, however, high-yield savings accounts. The options aren't many in Thailand but there are a couple.

### When Using a Savings Account

There is only one good reason for using a savings account: short-term savings. It is the money that is earmarked for emergencies (you should have an emergency fund) and spending goals (e.g., that sweet new sound system).

### High(er) Yield Savings Accounts

At the time of writing, the best option available is [TMB's "Dream Savings"](https://www.tmbbank.com/en/accounts/savings/dream-saving.html) account. It offers an interest rate of

## Mutual Funds

Mutual funds are funds made up of a pool of money collected from many investors to invest in securities like stocks, bonds, money market instruments, and other assets.

Mutual funds are actively managed (securities are bought and purchased by the fund manager).

## ETFs

ETFs are similar to mutual funds. However, they are not actively managed.

## Index Funds

Index funds are mutual funds or ETFs that track a group of individual stocks. For example, it is possible to buy *all* the stocks on the S&P 500 by buying an index fund that tracks the S&P 500.

The main benefit of index funds is that you can have a wide diversification of your investment portfolio by only buying one fund.

<aside>
💡 Buying index funds, in the long term, always outperform buying individual stocks.

Dividend investing is a strategy where you buy funds that will generate growth (just like the mutual and index funds) *and* those funds will also pay dividends. The payouts can be multiple times a year depending on the actual fund.
