# Proposal review with The Collective Studio


# Participants

- Tanny
- Julien
- Kop

# Agenda

- [x]  Review the proposal
    
    [CTSTU-quotation.pdf](Proposal%20review%20with%20The%20Collective%20Studio/CTSTU-quotation.pdf)
    
- [x]  Clarify process and deliverables

# Notes

- Project Management work:
    - Consulting.
    - Check 3-5 times.
    - No communication with the contractor. We need to manage this entirely.
    - All the above is included in the quote. It does not come at an extra fee and it is not deductible either.
- Phase 1: ideation. Figuring out the direction, creating early drawings.
- Phase 2: design. Turning the early drawings into proper designs.
- 3 months to complete.
- Availability unclear. He needs to get back to us.

# Questions

- [x]  What is the design process like?
- [x]  What kind of ideas does he have about the house? I want to make sure that he has some sort of vision, unlike the other company who provided rough designs that don't look too exciting.
- [x]  Project management fee: I want him to manage the project, but only *if* there is a project to manage. Can we agree that the PM fee will only be paid if we can get the project through? E.g., a bank loan is not possible.
- [x]  What exactly does the Project Management service cover?
- [x]  Does the design/blueprint include all necessary amenities (e.g., electricity, water lines)?
- [x]  Roughly how long would this design project take (understanding that there are dependencies on government bodies)?
- [x]  What's his availability? When could he start?
