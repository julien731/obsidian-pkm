## First Chat

[00:00:00] Julien: So what I was saying is I think it's a good opportunity for you to take this as kind of like a debrief from the trip, maybe when he's back.
[00:00:11] Julien: And in addition to everything we've been talking about already.
[00:00:20] Julien: Actually, I mean, in addition is more like a way to frame things.
[00:00:27] Julien: A way to frame things could be that
[00:00:30] Julien: and just sharing with her that seeing all of this really brought back all of the memories and everything from when you were actually doing this, which you have been doing for multiple years.
[00:00:45] Julien: And also realizing that, I mean, things is the same.
[00:00:52] Julien: It's the same now that it was before.
[00:00:53] Julien: It's the same here that it was before when I was working as well.
[00:00:59] Julien: And to then emphasize that I'm very confident we can make it work because I have done this.
[00:01:06] Julien: I know how to do this.
[00:01:07] Julien: I know how to take care of the people.
[00:01:09] Julien: I know how to take care of the sales.
[00:01:10] Julien: I know how to create the right experience.
[00:01:13] Julien: I'm confident that we can do this.
[00:01:15] Tanny: And actually, I disagree with her that this is only a side thing, that it won't make money.
[00:01:20] Tanny: I think this is our moneymaker.
[00:01:22] Julien: I think so too.
[00:01:24] Julien: The thing is that maybe to make sure that she doesn't take this wrong leap, it's not about which one is the moneymaker.
[00:01:32] Julien: It's not like that.
[00:01:34] Julien: You can have two successful businesses.
[00:01:37] Julien: It doesn't have to be, oh, this is the moneymaker, this is the side.
[00:01:39] Julien: No.
[00:01:40] Julien: It's like there's two different ideas.
[00:01:41] Julien: Both can make money.
[00:01:43] Julien: There doesn't have to be one main, one secondary.
[00:01:48] Julien: So having this debrief with her and then taking the opportunity to emphasize, sorry, not to emphasize, but to explain that I know how to do all of this, I have done this before, I've done this successfully, and maybe find a way not to be too obnoxious or anything, but you've been at top sales for multiple years.
[00:02:09] Julien: Not only you've done it, but you've done it very successfully.
[00:02:13] Julien: you know how to do this.
[00:02:14] Julien: And seeing all of this makes me, like if I were you, I'd say something like, yeah, it makes me realize that I can do this.
[00:02:21] Julien: This is what I can do.
[00:02:24] Julien: I can handle the sales, setting everything up around the sales.
[00:02:28] Julien: I can handle designing the experience.
[00:02:31] Julien: I can handle taking care of the people.
[00:02:35] Julien: At least for now, while the volumes are not too high.
[00:02:39] Julien: What I cannot do is handle
[00:02:42] Julien: The partner relationships in Korea, this requires more, it requires speaking Korean.
[00:02:49] Julien: So I think that this is where you can do things that I can't.
[00:02:54] Julien: Handling partner relationships, exploring the market further to develop the business.
[00:03:00] Julien: We've seen, we've found some clinics that are good.
[00:03:03] Julien: What else?
[00:03:04] Julien: what other options do we have where we can send people that basically enable us to cover more ground like what other procedures should we start covering but um yeah basically thinking about how do we expand reinforce the business from the korean side and this is where in a probably would be the best person to help so that's an opportunity to start defining the roles here
[00:03:31] Julien: I think that the angle of what you've done before and all of this bringing back all of the memories of when you were working at DB is a great angle actually.
[00:03:41] Tanny: I like it.
[00:03:42] Tanny: I really like it.
[00:03:43] Tanny: I enjoy talking to people, enjoy the whole experience.
[00:03:48] Tanny: The only thing was like it's just a toxic little environment but beside that, very good.
[00:03:58] Julien: You think about
[00:04:00] Julien: What needs to be done?
[00:04:05] Julien: You need to create the lead generation machine.
[00:04:10] Julien: This is where I can help.
[00:04:14] Julien: Once that's done, you need to design your sales funnel.
[00:04:22] Julien: We know it's a unique, I mean unique,
[00:04:29] Julien: It's not necessarily a mainstream kind of business.
[00:04:34] Julien: Meaning that the sales funnel is not going to be like you buy something online.
[00:04:43] Julien: It's not like that.
[00:04:44] Julien: This is very different.
[00:04:45] Julien: The sales funnel is very different.
[00:04:47] Julien: You need to handle people differently.
[00:04:49] Julien: It's going to be a longer cycle probably.
[00:04:51] Julien: You need to take care of reassuring people, things like that.
[00:04:57] Julien: So you start a business like this from scratch, you need to design that sales funnel.
[00:05:01] Julien: But you already know it.
[00:05:04] Julien: So there is no need to design this from scratch.
[00:05:08] Julien: You can take care of this.
[00:05:09] Julien: You can build that funnel because you know what works.
[00:05:17] Julien: Then after that, what do you need to do?
[00:05:20] Julien: You need to handle the logistics slash
[00:05:26] Julien: Customer experience.
[00:05:30] Julien: So what are the logistics gonna look like?
[00:05:31] Julien: You already know that, you have done it before.
[00:05:38] Julien: The customer experience, what is it gonna look like?
[00:05:41] Julien: Knowing that here you're talking about something medical, even though it's non-invasive, you need to think about
[00:05:47] Julien: people might be a little stressed and they're gonna be in a foreign country right they might be a little stressed they might need some help they might need some reassurance yeah so here is the thing again if you start this from crash you have to think about all this okay what might the customers think what might they want what might they need but you don't have to start from crash you've already know it you have done it before you have been there to hand hold the customers to bring them to the hospital yourself you know all of this
[00:06:15] Julien: So there's no need for somebody to spend time on figuring this out.
[00:06:18] Julien: You already know it.
[00:06:21] Julien: Where your knowledge and your limitations are going to be is that at this part you can design what the experience and what the journey needs to be like.
[00:06:32] Julien: But organizing it in Korea, this is probably where Ine should be taking care of it.
[00:06:39] Julien: discussing with partners, so you need to find out the partner, not the small heap guy.
[00:06:45] Julien: So you need to find out who's gonna be the partner.
[00:06:47] Julien: The hospital, an agency, as we discussed yesterday, do you need to hire somebody right away?
[00:06:53] Julien: Maybe not, hopefully not.
[00:06:54] Julien: You will need to hire somebody as quickly as possible so that you have full control over the customer experience.
[00:07:01] Julien: If you can start with a hiring, yeah, that's better.
[00:07:08] Julien: But even when you find this partner, yeah, I think one of the first goals should be, when you make enough money, reinvest the money right away to hire someone.
[00:07:17] Julien: That might require registering a business there, probably.
[00:07:20] Julien: I don't know, that needs to have some research, but for sure it will require that so that you can legally hire someone.
[00:07:27] Julien: In the meantime, you need to research for that partnership stuff.
[00:07:31] Julien: And then once you find somebody who seems like they would be a good partner, then somebody needs to handle the partner relationship.
[00:07:38] Julien: That should be innate.
[00:07:43] Julien: And you also need to, also part of this, there needs to be some customer feedback loop so that you can assess if your partners on the ground are doing a good job.
[00:07:55] Tanny: And what would be your responsibility and Zach's responsibility?
[00:07:59] Julien: I don't know, for me, I can take care of the lead generation part, basically.
[00:08:04] Julien: All the website stuff, setting up the whole infrastructure.
[00:08:08] Julien: How do you set things up so you can smooth conversations with people, get people from multiple channels, be able to easily convert them, set up all the tools, set up all the processes that I can help with.
[00:08:21] Julien: Idiot, baby.
[00:08:25] Julien: first step me and you finish the website once the website is finished which by the way I think I want to move faster on this I've been spending time because I'm not yet completely happy with the design and while this is still true I don't think that this should be a blocker I think that we can just iterate you can just release this finish this release it we don't have a pricing yeah so that's one of the things I need to figure out
[00:08:49] Julien: Then release the website right away so we can start to have this index, now to have people hopefully start to find it, start to work on optimizing for AI and all of that stuff.
[00:09:01] Julien: And at the same time can iterate on the UI and make it a little bit nicer, a little bit more appealing.
[00:09:07] Julien: the most important is that the ux i'm going to cover that part like having a proper ux having a proper conversion funnel on the website that part i'll cover then setting up all of the systems so that you can talk to people from line from facebook from ig putting a live chat on the website all that i'll take care of that too setting up the whole crm so you have a very clear pipeline so that you don't let anything fall to the cracks that you know exactly
[00:09:34] Julien: your numbers also like how well are you doing in terms of conversion all that like all of that i can take care of it all the tech all of the tooling all of that i can take care of it
[00:10:15] Tanny: What do you think?
[00:10:21] Tanny: I think that it's great that we have this kind of like establishing ideas of who will do what.
[00:10:33] Tanny: I think like my mind is still a little worried about the business registration part.
[00:10:38] Tanny: I'm a little afraid that INE will not open enough for this.
[00:10:45] Julien: This needs to be a prerequisite when you do the debrief.
[00:10:49] Julien: I think that this is going to be then the opportunity to talk about everything that we just discussed.
[00:10:55] Tanny: Actually, before getting into the who should be doing what and all that, if you open with... Should we do this with four of us or just me and Ine?
[00:11:05] Julien: I think you probably should have a first name with Ine, just you two.
[00:11:11] Julien: In terms of how to present things, what I'm thinking now is that probably a strong opening would be to start with that whole thing about your experience.
[00:11:20] Julien: And basically saying, and if I understand you correctly, please correct me if it's not the case, but basically explaining all this and saying that, yeah, you're very confident that you can make this work.
[00:11:30] Tanny: I am, yeah.
[00:11:31] Julien: To make this work.
[00:11:34] Julien: And this is where you can start establishing your ground.
[00:11:37] Julien: So I think I'm very confident we can make it work.
[00:11:40] Julien: However, it will not work with Mohin.
[00:11:43] Julien: This is not possible.
[00:11:45] Julien: If we are to make this work, we need a proper partner who's going to be providing or who's going to be able to provide the experience we need to provide to Thai customers.
[00:11:57] Julien: Thai customers, it will not work with them.
[00:12:00] Julien: This will be horrible for them.
[00:12:03] Julien: We just need to be on the same page that we can make this work, but not with Moif.
[00:12:09] Julien: And I'm sure we can find other partners.
[00:12:13] Julien: It's, like we said yesterday, it is impossible that in the whole of Korea, only this random Indian dude can do this.
[00:12:22] Julien: It's just not possible.
[00:12:24] Julien: So, 100% sure you can find another partner.
[00:12:30] Julien: This is where Ine
[00:12:33] Julien: would have the most impact or to figure out okay who would be a great partner not some random dude somebody who's got experience who knows how to deal with the customers so yes ideally like a medical tourism agency or a clinic basically people who are already used to dealing with customers with with actually patients is the better term who are used to dealing with patients
[00:13:00] Julien: Patience is very different from a retail customer.
[00:13:03] Julien: They're worried about things.
[00:13:04] Julien: They're gonna do things to their body.
[00:13:07] Julien: They're worried about it.
[00:13:09] Julien: There's gonna be a language barrier.
[00:13:11] Julien: So they're worried, they're stressed.
[00:13:15] Julien: You need to know how to take care of these people to make them feel good, make them feel relaxed, to make them feel confident, comfortable.
[00:13:24] UNKNOWN: Yeah.
[00:13:26] Julien: It's essential.
[00:13:27] Julien: So I think that this is kind of like the first checkpoint in your conversation, and I think this is the part where you should do this with only you and Ine.
[00:13:34] Julien: Because this is where you need to test, like, are we gonna be able to work together?
[00:13:41] Julien: And I need to emphasize, here we are.
[00:13:44] Julien: It's not a side thing.
[00:13:47] Julien: There is no one is the money maker, one is not.
[00:13:51] Julien: There can be two successful money making businesses.
[00:13:57] Julien: I am confident I know how to make this work because I've done it for many years.
[00:14:04] Julien: I was even at top sales at Destination Beauty.
[00:14:08] Julien: I've done taking people to the hospital.
[00:14:11] Julien: I've done going to the trade shows.
[00:14:13] Julien: I've done all of it.
[00:14:18] Julien: But I know
[00:14:19] Julien: for a fact that it will not work with Mohit.
[00:14:23] Tanny: So I want to know.
[00:14:24] Tanny: It will not work with Mohit.
[00:14:25] Julien: So I think you need to get to that point where you just ask her straight out.
[00:14:28] Julien: Are you with me on this?
[00:14:34] Tanny: It will be in a different direction that we're going to take.
[00:14:41] Julien: Yes.
[00:14:41] Julien: Just to emphasize, I am very confident.
[00:14:45] Julien: It doesn't mean that there's no possibility it will not work, but nothing is 100% guaranteed in life.
[00:14:53] Julien: But if you're confident, then make it very clear, make it very much known.
[00:14:58] Julien: I'm very confident and I know how to get this to work.
[00:15:02] Julien: And I know it's not with money.
[00:15:03] Tanny: And not just Thai people also.
[00:15:05] Tanny: I see speakers, expats, people from everywhere.
[00:15:10] Tanny: I can see that we're not just in Thailand.
[00:15:15] Julien: Yeah, I mean you can expand it later on, why not?
[00:15:18] Julien: Nothing stops you.
[00:15:23] Julien: It's, in this business, the experience is gonna be everything.
[00:15:33] Julien: It literally is.
[00:15:36] Julien: Somebody with, I mean if not just somebody, if in general people have a good experience,
[00:15:43] Julien: they're gonna be happy they're gonna recommend you know that in this world this power social media is very high if they speak highly of you that's gonna work you collect testimonials so you reinforce that social proof social connection
[00:15:57] Julien: And there's probably going to be some recurring customers as well.
[00:16:00] Julien: Because all of this stuff, like this Botox and all that, it's not a one-time thing, right?
[00:16:06] Julien: So you're going to have recurring customers.
[00:16:08] Julien: But on the other side, if people have a bad experience, they're going to fucking trash you.
[00:16:12] Julien: The business is dead.
[00:16:14] Julien: If this is the goal there, it's like, oh yeah, sorry, it's late.
[00:16:16] Julien: Sorry, I forgot to organize this.
[00:16:19] Julien: People are going to be fucking...
[00:16:21] Julien: Imagine, they're going to be fucking panicking.
[00:16:24] Julien: I don't like...
[00:16:25] Julien: Even...
[00:16:27] Julien: thinking from not from the business standpoint from speaking from a human standpoint like imagine these poor fucking people yeah i mean we were there we were we were waiting finish it baby i'm good a little forward so yeah i think that's that's the way i'm i'm thinking that you should move forward with the next steps
[00:16:53] Julien: Now is the time to align very clearly with Ine about the plan, about the business, about what can and cannot happen, what would and would not work.
[00:17:07] Julien: Because, okay, she's a little still stuck on this Malik guy.
[00:17:17] Tanny: If you can unlock that.
[00:17:19] Tanny: I think Zach is with us.
[00:17:21] Tanny: But I just need to talk to Ine.
[00:17:23] Tanny: I need to talk to Ine, but she's in Korea also.
[00:17:29] Tanny: Actually, I have work here in Thailand.
[00:17:32] Tanny: It's not work.
[00:17:34] Tanny: Otherwise, I would already still be in Korea and talk to her.
[00:17:37] Tanny: I can just go to Korea to talk to her about this also.
[00:17:45] Tanny: That's another point.
[00:17:49] Tanny: is that I would need to have a partner for Northworth to handle some work for me when I'm away.
[00:18:00] Julien: Well, that's a different conversation and we need to explore much deeper what we talked about yesterday with how can you leverage AI because that could really make a big difference.
[00:18:11] Julien: But let's keep that conversation for later.
[00:18:16] Julien: if you can unlock that little mental barrier that she has about mohid and all of that then she can start to really make significant contributions because now if you if you can unlock that and give her the direction as you say she probably needs a little bit more direction
[00:18:46] Julien: If you can set that direction, set that vision, then she can just hit the ground running and start to figure out, okay, all the partnership stuff.
[00:18:56] Julien: Maybe go and visit these potential partners.
[00:19:01] Julien: Go and visit, talk with them, see if they're up to the standards, all of that.
[00:19:06] Julien: There's going to be a lot to do on that.
[00:19:09] Tanny: Yeah.
[00:19:13] Julien: So yeah, I think you had a key...
[00:19:17] Tanny: turning point here it's essential that you can both align on this otherwise it will not work so let's prepare the debrief of what i need to have to ending yeah before we before thank you before we actually
[00:19:38] Tanny: top four people.
[00:19:40] Julien: Yes, I think so.
[00:19:41] Julien: I think you need to have this.
[00:19:43] Julien: It's like you said, let's plan it.
[00:19:45] Julien: See to what extent you want to go with the debrief.
[00:19:50] Julien: The main goal with this debrief, in my opinion, should be to confirm whether or not it's going to work with you both working together on this.
[00:20:00] Julien: Meaning, basically, is she going to open up to, okay, Mohit is not the answer.
[00:20:06] Julien: I think the good thing is going to be if you unlock that, then she's probably going to be much more...
[00:20:16] Julien: I think that's going to unlock her on going much deeper in things.
[00:20:20] Julien: Because if she agrees and understands and agrees, then the next thing is, okay, that's going to be a hard dive into who's the right partner.
[00:20:39] Julien: Okay.

## Second Chat

[00:00:00] Julien: So what I was saying is I think it's a good opportunity for you to take this as kind of like a debrief from the trip, maybe when he's back.
[00:00:11] Julien: And in addition to everything we've been talking about already.
[00:00:20] Julien: Actually, I mean, in addition is more like a way to frame things.
[00:00:27] Julien: A way to frame things could be that
[00:00:30] Julien: and just sharing with her that seeing all of this really brought back all of the memories and everything from when you were actually doing this, which you have been doing for multiple years.
[00:00:45] Julien: And also realizing that, I mean, things is the same.
[00:00:52] Julien: It's the same now that it was before.
[00:00:53] Julien: It's the same here that it was before when I was working as well.
[00:00:59] Julien: And to then emphasize that I'm very confident we can make it work because I have done this.
[00:01:06] Julien: I know how to do this.
[00:01:07] Julien: I know how to take care of the people.
[00:01:09] Julien: I know how to take care of the sales.
[00:01:10] Julien: I know how to create the right experience.
[00:01:13] Julien: I'm confident that we can do this.
[00:01:15] Tanny: And actually, I disagree with her that this is only a side thing, that it won't make money.
[00:01:20] Tanny: I think this is our moneymaker.
[00:01:22] Julien: I think so too.
[00:01:24] Julien: The thing is that maybe to make sure that she doesn't take this wrong leap, it's not about which one is the moneymaker.
[00:01:32] Julien: It's not like that.
[00:01:34] Julien: You can have two successful businesses.
[00:01:37] Julien: It doesn't have to be, oh, this is the moneymaker, this is the side.
[00:01:39] Julien: No.
[00:01:40] Julien: It's like there's two different ideas.
[00:01:41] Julien: Both can make money.
[00:01:43] Julien: There doesn't have to be one main, one secondary.
[00:01:48] Julien: So having this debrief with her and then taking the opportunity to emphasize, sorry, not to emphasize, but to explain that I know how to do all of this, I have done this before, I've done this successfully, and maybe find a way not to be too obnoxious or anything, but you've been at top sales for multiple years.
[00:02:09] Julien: Not only you've done it, but you've done it very successfully.
[00:02:13] Julien: you know how to do this.
[00:02:14] Julien: And seeing all of this makes me, like if I were you, I'd say something like, yeah, it makes me realize that I can do this.
[00:02:21] Julien: This is what I can do.
[00:02:24] Julien: I can handle the sales, setting everything up around the sales.
[00:02:28] Julien: I can handle designing the experience.
[00:02:31] Julien: I can handle taking care of the people.
[00:02:35] Julien: At least for now, while the volumes are not too high.
[00:02:39] Julien: What I cannot do is handle
[00:02:42] Julien: The partner relationships in Korea, this requires more, it requires speaking Korean.
[00:02:49] Julien: So I think that this is where you can do things that I can't.
[00:02:54] Julien: Handling partner relationships, exploring the market further to develop the business.
[00:03:00] Julien: We've seen, we've found some clinics that are good.
[00:03:03] Julien: What else?
[00:03:04] Julien: what other options do we have where we can send people that basically enable us to cover more ground like what other procedures should we start covering but um yeah basically thinking about how do we expand reinforce the business from the korean side and this is where in a probably would be the best person to help so that's an opportunity to start defining the roles here
[00:03:31] Julien: I think that the angle of what you've done before and all of this bringing back all of the memories of when you were working at DB is a great angle actually.
[00:03:41] Tanny: I like it.
[00:03:42] Tanny: I really like it.
[00:03:43] Tanny: I enjoy talking to people, enjoy the whole experience.
[00:03:48] Tanny: The only thing was like it's just a toxic little environment but beside that, very good.
[00:03:58] Julien: You think about
[00:04:00] Julien: What needs to be done?
[00:04:05] Julien: You need to create the lead generation machine.
[00:04:10] Julien: This is where I can help.
[00:04:14] Julien: Once that's done, you need to design your sales funnel.
[00:04:22] Julien: We know it's a unique, I mean unique,
[00:04:29] Julien: It's not necessarily a mainstream kind of business.
[00:04:34] Julien: Meaning that the sales funnel is not going to be like you buy something online.
[00:04:43] Julien: It's not like that.
[00:04:44] Julien: This is very different.
[00:04:45] Julien: The sales funnel is very different.
[00:04:47] Julien: You need to handle people differently.
[00:04:49] Julien: It's going to be a longer cycle probably.
[00:04:51] Julien: You need to take care of reassuring people, things like that.
[00:04:57] Julien: So you start a business like this from scratch, you need to design that sales funnel.
[00:05:01] Julien: But you already know it.
[00:05:04] Julien: So there is no need to design this from scratch.
[00:05:08] Julien: You can take care of this.
[00:05:09] Julien: You can build that funnel because you know what works.
[00:05:17] Julien: Then after that, what do you need to do?
[00:05:20] Julien: You need to handle the logistics slash
[00:05:26] Julien: Customer experience.
[00:05:30] Julien: So what are the logistics gonna look like?
[00:05:31] Julien: You already know that, you have done it before.
[00:05:38] Julien: The customer experience, what is it gonna look like?
[00:05:41] Julien: Knowing that here you're talking about something medical, even though it's non-invasive, you need to think about
[00:05:47] Julien: people might be a little stressed and they're gonna be in a foreign country right they might be a little stressed they might need some help they might need some reassurance yeah so here is the thing again if you start this from crash you have to think about all this okay what might the customers think what might they want what might they need but you don't have to start from crash you've already know it you have done it before you have been there to hand hold the customers to bring them to the hospital yourself you know all of this
[00:06:15] Julien: So there's no need for somebody to spend time on figuring this out.
[00:06:18] Julien: You already know it.
[00:06:21] Julien: Where your knowledge and your limitations are going to be is that at this part you can design what the experience and what the journey needs to be like.
[00:06:32] Julien: But organizing it in Korea, this is probably where Ine should be taking care of it.
[00:06:39] Julien: discussing with partners, so you need to find out the partner, not the small heap guy.
[00:06:45] Julien: So you need to find out who's gonna be the partner.
[00:06:47] Julien: The hospital, an agency, as we discussed yesterday, do you need to hire somebody right away?
[00:06:53] Julien: Maybe not, hopefully not.
[00:06:54] Julien: You will need to hire somebody as quickly as possible so that you have full control over the customer experience.
[00:07:01] Julien: If you can start with a hiring, yeah, that's better.
[00:07:08] Julien: But even when you find this partner, yeah, I think one of the first goals should be, when you make enough money, reinvest the money right away to hire someone.
[00:07:17] Julien: That might require registering a business there, probably.
[00:07:20] Julien: I don't know, that needs to have some research, but for sure it will require that so that you can legally hire someone.
[00:07:27] Julien: In the meantime, you need to research for that partnership stuff.
[00:07:31] Julien: And then once you find somebody who seems like they would be a good partner, then somebody needs to handle the partner relationship.
[00:07:38] Julien: That should be innate.
[00:07:43] Julien: And you also need to, also part of this, there needs to be some customer feedback loop so that you can assess if your partners on the ground are doing a good job.
[00:07:55] Tanny: And what would be your responsibility and Zach's responsibility?
[00:07:59] Julien: I don't know, for me, I can take care of the lead generation part, basically.
[00:08:04] Julien: All the website stuff, setting up the whole infrastructure.
[00:08:08] Julien: How do you set things up so you can smooth conversations with people, get people from multiple channels, be able to easily convert them, set up all the tools, set up all the processes that I can help with.
[00:08:21] Julien: Idiot, baby.
[00:08:25] Julien: first step me and you finish the website once the website is finished which by the way I think I want to move faster on this I've been spending time because I'm not yet completely happy with the design and while this is still true I don't think that this should be a blocker I think that we can just iterate you can just release this finish this release it we don't have a pricing yeah so that's one of the things I need to figure out
[00:08:49] Julien: Then release the website right away so we can start to have this index, now to have people hopefully start to find it, start to work on optimizing for AI and all of that stuff.
[00:09:01] Julien: And at the same time can iterate on the UI and make it a little bit nicer, a little bit more appealing.
[00:09:07] Julien: the most important is that the ux i'm going to cover that part like having a proper ux having a proper conversion funnel on the website that part i'll cover then setting up all of the systems so that you can talk to people from line from facebook from ig putting a live chat on the website all that i'll take care of that too setting up the whole crm so you have a very clear pipeline so that you don't let anything fall to the cracks that you know exactly
[00:09:34] Julien: your numbers also like how well are you doing in terms of conversion all that like all of that i can take care of it all the tech all of the tooling all of that i can take care of it
[00:10:15] Tanny: What do you think?
[00:10:21] Tanny: I think that it's great that we have this kind of like establishing ideas of who will do what.
[00:10:33] Tanny: I think like my mind is still a little worried about the business registration part.
[00:10:38] Tanny: I'm a little afraid that INE will not open enough for this.
[00:10:45] Julien: This needs to be a prerequisite when you do the debrief.
[00:10:49] Julien: I think that this is going to be then the opportunity to talk about everything that we just discussed.
[00:10:55] Tanny: Actually, before getting into the who should be doing what and all that, if you open with... Should we do this with four of us or just me and Ine?
[00:11:05] Julien: I think you probably should have a first name with Ine, just you two.
[00:11:11] Julien: In terms of how to present things, what I'm thinking now is that probably a strong opening would be to start with that whole thing about your experience.
[00:11:20] Julien: And basically saying, and if I understand you correctly, please correct me if it's not the case, but basically explaining all this and saying that, yeah, you're very confident that you can make this work.
[00:11:30] Tanny: I am, yeah.
[00:11:31] Julien: To make this work.
[00:11:34] Julien: And this is where you can start establishing your ground.
[00:11:37] Julien: So I think I'm very confident we can make it work.
[00:11:40] Julien: However, it will not work with Mohin.
[00:11:43] Julien: This is not possible.
[00:11:45] Julien: If we are to make this work, we need a proper partner who's going to be providing or who's going to be able to provide the experience we need to provide to Thai customers.
[00:11:57] Julien: Thai customers, it will not work with them.
[00:12:00] Julien: This will be horrible for them.
[00:12:03] Julien: We just need to be on the same page that we can make this work, but not with Moif.
[00:12:09] Julien: And I'm sure we can find other partners.
[00:12:13] Julien: It's, like we said yesterday, it is impossible that in the whole of Korea, only this random Indian dude can do this.
[00:12:22] Julien: It's just not possible.
[00:12:24] Julien: So, 100% sure you can find another partner.
[00:12:30] Julien: This is where Ine
[00:12:33] Julien: would have the most impact or to figure out okay who would be a great partner not some random dude somebody who's got experience who knows how to deal with the customers so yes ideally like a medical tourism agency or a clinic basically people who are already used to dealing with customers with with actually patients is the better term who are used to dealing with patients
[00:13:00] Julien: Patience is very different from a retail customer.
[00:13:03] Julien: They're worried about things.
[00:13:04] Julien: They're gonna do things to their body.
[00:13:07] Julien: They're worried about it.
[00:13:09] Julien: There's gonna be a language barrier.
[00:13:11] Julien: So they're worried, they're stressed.
[00:13:15] Julien: You need to know how to take care of these people to make them feel good, make them feel relaxed, to make them feel confident, comfortable.
[00:13:24] UNKNOWN: Yeah.
[00:13:26] Julien: It's essential.
[00:13:27] Julien: So I think that this is kind of like the first checkpoint in your conversation, and I think this is the part where you should do this with only you and Ine.
[00:13:34] Julien: Because this is where you need to test, like, are we gonna be able to work together?
[00:13:41] Julien: And I need to emphasize, here we are.
[00:13:44] Julien: It's not a side thing.
[00:13:47] Julien: There is no one is the money maker, one is not.
[00:13:51] Julien: There can be two successful money making businesses.
[00:13:57] Julien: I am confident I know how to make this work because I've done it for many years.
[00:14:04] Julien: I was even at top sales at Destination Beauty.
[00:14:08] Julien: I've done taking people to the hospital.
[00:14:11] Julien: I've done going to the trade shows.
[00:14:13] Julien: I've done all of it.
[00:14:18] Julien: But I know
[00:14:19] Julien: for a fact that it will not work with Mohit.
[00:14:23] Tanny: So I want to know.
[00:14:24] Tanny: It will not work with Mohit.
[00:14:25] Julien: So I think you need to get to that point where you just ask her straight out.
[00:14:28] Julien: Are you with me on this?
[00:14:34] Tanny: It will be in a different direction that we're going to take.
[00:14:41] Julien: Yes.
[00:14:41] Julien: Just to emphasize, I am very confident.
[00:14:45] Julien: It doesn't mean that there's no possibility it will not work, but nothing is 100% guaranteed in life.
[00:14:53] Julien: But if you're confident, then make it very clear, make it very much known.
[00:14:58] Julien: I'm very confident and I know how to get this to work.
[00:15:02] Julien: And I know it's not with money.
[00:15:03] Tanny: And not just Thai people also.
[00:15:05] Tanny: I see speakers, expats, people from everywhere.
[00:15:10] Tanny: I can see that we're not just in Thailand.
[00:15:15] Julien: Yeah, I mean you can expand it later on, why not?
[00:15:18] Julien: Nothing stops you.
[00:15:23] Julien: It's, in this business, the experience is gonna be everything.
[00:15:33] Julien: It literally is.
[00:15:36] Julien: Somebody with, I mean if not just somebody, if in general people have a good experience,
[00:15:43] Julien: they're gonna be happy they're gonna recommend you know that in this world this power social media is very high if they speak highly of you that's gonna work you collect testimonials so you reinforce that social proof social connection
[00:15:57] Julien: And there's probably going to be some recurring customers as well.
[00:16:00] Julien: Because all of this stuff, like this Botox and all that, it's not a one-time thing, right?
[00:16:06] Julien: So you're going to have recurring customers.
[00:16:08] Julien: But on the other side, if people have a bad experience, they're going to fucking trash you.
[00:16:12] Julien: The business is dead.
[00:16:14] Julien: If this is the goal there, it's like, oh yeah, sorry, it's late.
[00:16:16] Julien: Sorry, I forgot to organize this.
[00:16:19] Julien: People are going to be fucking...
[00:16:21] Julien: Imagine, they're going to be fucking panicking.
[00:16:24] Julien: I don't like...
[00:16:25] Julien: Even...
[00:16:27] Julien: thinking from not from the business standpoint from speaking from a human standpoint like imagine these poor fucking people yeah i mean we were there we were we were waiting finish it baby i'm good a little forward so yeah i think that's that's the way i'm i'm thinking that you should move forward with the next steps
[00:16:53] Julien: Now is the time to align very clearly with Ine about the plan, about the business, about what can and cannot happen, what would and would not work.
[00:17:07] Julien: Because, okay, she's a little still stuck on this Malik guy.
[00:17:17] Tanny: If you can unlock that.
[00:17:19] Tanny: I think Zach is with us.
[00:17:21] Tanny: But I just need to talk to Ine.
[00:17:23] Tanny: I need to talk to Ine, but she's in Korea also.
[00:17:29] Tanny: Actually, I have work here in Thailand.
[00:17:32] Tanny: It's not work.
[00:17:34] Tanny: Otherwise, I would already still be in Korea and talk to her.
[00:17:37] Tanny: I can just go to Korea to talk to her about this also.
[00:17:45] Tanny: That's another point.
[00:17:49] Tanny: is that I would need to have a partner for Northworth to handle some work for me when I'm away.
[00:18:00] Julien: Well, that's a different conversation and we need to explore much deeper what we talked about yesterday with how can you leverage AI because that could really make a big difference.
[00:18:11] Julien: But let's keep that conversation for later.
[00:18:16] Julien: if you can unlock that little mental barrier that she has about mohid and all of that then she can start to really make significant contributions because now if you if you can unlock that and give her the direction as you say she probably needs a little bit more direction
[00:18:46] Julien: If you can set that direction, set that vision, then she can just hit the ground running and start to figure out, okay, all the partnership stuff.
[00:18:56] Julien: Maybe go and visit these potential partners.
[00:19:01] Julien: Go and visit, talk with them, see if they're up to the standards, all of that.
[00:19:06] Julien: There's going to be a lot to do on that.
[00:19:09] Tanny: Yeah.
[00:19:13] Julien: So yeah, I think you had a key...
[00:19:17] Tanny: turning point here it's essential that you can both align on this otherwise it will not work so let's prepare the debrief of what i need to have to ending yeah before we before thank you before we actually
[00:19:38] Tanny: top four people.
[00:19:40] Julien: Yes, I think so.
[00:19:41] Julien: I think you need to have this.
[00:19:43] Julien: It's like you said, let's plan it.
[00:19:45] Julien: See to what extent you want to go with the debrief.
[00:19:50] Julien: The main goal with this debrief, in my opinion, should be to confirm whether or not it's going to work with you both working together on this.
[00:20:00] Julien: Meaning, basically, is she going to open up to, okay, Mohit is not the answer.
[00:20:06] Julien: I think the good thing is going to be if you unlock that, then she's probably going to be much more...
[00:20:16] Julien: I think that's going to unlock her on going much deeper in things.
[00:20:20] Julien: Because if she agrees and understands and agrees, then the next thing is, okay, that's going to be a hard dive into who's the right partner.
[00:20:39] Julien: Okay.
