Julien and Tanny held a strategic planning session for GlowCheck, their medical tourism venture sending clients from Thailand to Korea for cosmetic procedures. The central discussion revolved around the need to replace their current Korean partner Mohit, who delivered a poor client experience during a recent trip, and how to align co-founder Inae on this direction. They outlined role responsibilities, mapped out the business workflow (lead generation → sales funnel → logistics → customer experience), and agreed that Tanny needs to have a critical face-to-face debrief with Inae before moving forward.

**Date:** February 2026 (exact date not specified in transcript)
**Duration:** ~38 minutes (across two recordings)

## Key Discussion Points

### Debrief Strategy with Inae

Julien coached Tanny on how to approach a pivotal conversation with co-founder Inae. The recommended framing: lead with Tanny's experience from years at Destination Beauty (where she was a top salesperson), emphasize confidence in making the business work, but make it clear that the current partner Mohit is not viable. Julien stressed this should be a one-on-one, face-to-face conversation between Tanny and Inae — not a group call. The goal is to test whether Tanny and Inae can align and work together effectively on this venture.

### The Mohit Problem

The recent Korea trip exposed serious issues with their current partner Mohit. He was unresponsive despite receiving a detailed itinerary in advance. He sent them to a clinic (Doctor Designer Clinic) that had no knowledge of their arrangement, only spoke Korean, and provided rough service. Julien and Tanny agreed unanimously that continuing with Mohit would lead to terrible customer experiences and kill the business. As Julien put it — it's impossible that in all of Korea, only one person can do this. Finding a proper partner (ideally a medical tourism agency or clinic experienced with international patients) is the top priority.

### "Two Businesses, Not One Main and One Side"

A recurring tension is that Inae views the medical tourism side as secondary to another venture (an app). Julien and Tanny want to reframe this: both businesses can be successful and profitable — there's no need to rank them. However, the medical tourism business can generate revenue faster and with less upfront investment, potentially funding the other venture. Julien suggested presenting this as one unified plan with two branches rather than two competing plans.

### Role Definitions & Responsibilities

The team mapped out who should own what:

- **Tanny:** Sales, customer experience design, sales funnel, client hand-holding, logistics coordination, leveraging her Destination Beauty expertise. Long-term: may need sales support hires in Thailand as volume grows.
- **Inae:** All Korea operations — partner research, partner relationships, on-the-ground coordination, market exploration (new clinics, new procedures), business registration research. She becomes the person in charge of everything Korea-related.
- **Julien:** Lead generation infrastructure, website completion and UX, conversion funnel optimization, CRM setup, multi-channel communication tools (LINE, Facebook, IG, live chat), all tech and tooling. Also helping optimize workflows with AI.
- **Zach:** Mentioned as aligned with the plan; specific role not deeply defined yet.

### Business Operations Workflow

Julien outlined the key operational components: (1) lead generation machine, (2) sales funnel design (noting this is a high-trust, longer-cycle sale — not e-commerce), (3) logistics and customer experience management, (4) partner coordination in Korea, and (5) customer feedback loops to ensure quality control. Tanny's experience means most of this doesn't need to be designed from scratch.

### Website & Tech Infrastructure

Julien expressed urgency about finishing and launching the website even if the design isn't perfect yet — iterating after launch rather than waiting. Key blockers: pricing hasn't been determined yet. Post-launch priorities include SEO, AI optimization, and setting up communication channels and CRM for pipeline management.

### Hiring & Scaling Plan

First hire priority: someone on the ground in Korea to control the customer experience (will require business registration research). Second priority: sales support in Thailand once lead volume grows. Julien emphasized leveraging AI to minimize headcount needs, with that being a deeper conversation for later.

## Decisions Made

|#|Decision|Context|
|---|---|---|
|1|Mohit must be replaced as Korean partner|Recent trip showed unacceptable service — unresponsive, disorganized, language barriers, rough clinic experience|
|2|Tanny will have a 1-on-1 face-to-face debrief with Inae|This is the critical alignment checkpoint before any group discussion with all four founders|
|3|Frame the two businesses as equal, not primary/secondary|Inae currently sees medical tourism as a "side thing" — reframing is essential for alignment|
|4|Launch the website before it's perfect and iterate|Design polish shouldn't block indexing, SEO, and early lead capture|
|5|Validate the business with a partner before registering a Korean entity|Business registration and first hire come after initial revenue validation|
|6|Inae owns all Korea operations; Tanny owns sales & CX; Julien owns tech & lead gen|First formal attempt at defining roles — previously "winging it"|

## Action Items

|#|Action|Owner|Deadline|Notes|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|Prepare the debrief talking points for conversation with Inae|Tanny|Before Inae returns from Korea|Based on the Korea trip experience; lead with DB experience angle|
|2|Create a mini business plan for GlowCheck|Tanny + Julien|TBD|Vision, steps to get there, roles — not a formal BS doc, just an outline. GlowCheck website plan exists but the broader business plan doesn't|
|3|Finish and launch the website|Julien + Tanny|ASAP|Pricing still needs to be determined; launch even with imperfect design|
|4|Set up CRM and multi-channel communication tools|Julien|TBD|LINE, Facebook, IG, live chat, pipeline tracking|
|5|Research potential Korean partners (medical tourism agencies / clinics)|Inae (pending alignment)|TBD|Need partners experienced with international patients; this starts after the debrief|
|6|Research Korean business registration requirements|Inae (pending alignment)|TBD|Needed for eventually hiring someone on the ground|
|7|Explore AI leverage opportunities for workflow optimization|Julien|Later|Discussed briefly; to be explored in more depth separately|
|8|Tanny to explore former Destination Beauty network connections|Tanny|TBD|Considering reaching out to former colleagues like CityFrame for potential cross-collaboration; Julien cautioned to be strategic since leads are valuable|

## Open Questions

|#|Question|Owner|Context|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|Will Inae agree to move away from Mohit?|Tanny (to resolve in debrief)|This is the key unlock — if she doesn't agree, the partnership may not work|
|2|What is the pricing model for services?|Tanny + Julien|Blocker for website launch|
|3|What does Korean business registration look like for hiring?|Inae / Zach|Zach may have experience as a non-Korean doing business in Korea|
|4|Who will cover Tanny's Northworks work when she travels to Korea?|Tanny|She mentioned needing a partner or coverage at Northworks during trips|
|5|What other procedures/clinics should be covered beyond current scope?|Team|Part of expanding the offering — more ground to cover|
|6|How can AI be leveraged to reduce staffing needs?|Julien|Briefly raised but deferred to a later conversation|
|7|Is cross-collaboration with former DB contacts (e.g., CityFrame) viable?|Tanny|Needs careful consideration — leads are precious, don't give them away|
