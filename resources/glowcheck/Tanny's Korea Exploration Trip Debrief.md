Tanny's written debrief of her exploration trip to Korea with co-founder Inae, where they visited four cosmetic clinics to evaluate them for the [[resources/glowcheck/Tanny & Julien's Debrief Meeting Summary|GlowCheck]] medical tourism business. The trip exposed major issues with their Korean partner Mohit and identified Vands and AIVE as promising clinics.

## Debrief

I am debriefing my experience this week in Korea.
I went to Korea with Inae to experience procedures first hand.
We were under the impression that Mohit will take care of everything since we sent him our itinerary. Also we already informed him about our intends to go to 3 main clinics. YSLeeds, Dr. Go and Artisan clinic under a certain prices.

We have told Mohit already in advance, we went our details already. He asked for my passport and Inae’s passport. We were curious why he needs her passport since she in Korean, an ID would be suffice.

He insisted we send the passports details, we sent it. So we hope to ge the appointment accordingly.

However, the day before we fly he said he couldnt get the appointment to those 3 clinics and said that he will book us in other clinics instead but did not send us any info prior us leaving thailand.

### Clinic 1: Doctor Designer Clinic

Once we arrived on Monday, he sent the details over, and sent us the info of one clinic and set up a time. We went to the appointment clinic called Dr. Designer or something.

We arrived, informed them we have a booking. They all confused that we showed up 1 foreigner and 1 korean. They have been informed that there will be 2 foreigners.

With that being said, there were no english speaker. Everything was in Korean. I had a hard time understanding procedures and prices. 

We were havig a consultation with a sales person, not a doctor. She looked at my face, analyzed and then advise some procedures. I has my mind set on the botox and the prices are quite good and pico toning with vitamin. I paid then she led us to the locker room and then took a photo of my face (no explanation or any chat about my face conditions) so I went straight to pico toning with no instruction, the doctor speaks a little english. Then the vitamin, then the botox. No numbing agent, a lazy handed me a cold roller to roll on my face that was all. Then the doctor started to injecting botox, he was fast and not gentle at all, he mumble some words that I didnt understand. It was Inae who helped me. She said I need to crunch my jaw, I did, but some how he injected harshly, I got instant big bruise. I was in pain, its was quite harsh. I will not go back or recommend anyone to go there.


After we left, we agree that this clinic was not good and we wont be sending people there. No english speaker and not good experience.

### Clinic 2: Vands Clinic (Main Branch & Myeongdong)

The next day, Inae found out that her friends went to Vands clinic and got some good expereinces. So we went there without booking, it was fine the clinic looks nice and clean. The overall experience was very good, they have English speaking staff and the staff were very knowledgable and provide us with very good explanations. We were very pleased. Inae got her procedures done. They did the skin analysis for her before thay starts analyzing anything. They even give her the result.

After that we went to Vands 2nd branch in Myeongdong where they have a thai speaking staff. The clinic was busier but still welcoming. We waited but not too long, they did the skin analysis and then I got to talk to the Thai lady which she showed me the skin analysis result and advise me on what I need and what’s not good for me. I had a onda lifing done. The doctor speak english and was comforting me during the procedures. 


We both like Vands, Inae asked about the kick backs, they dont provide kick back but they give credits.

Mohit was pretty much quiet, he said he has the event to attend, but we told him about this trip in advance, there should not be any excuse. Luckily we were there to test it out first.

### Clinic 3: Onyuu Clinic

The next day (Wed) Mohit sent us 3 more clinics but no booking was made, we can only go to see the clinics, he did not send any prices. Also the price he shared before are invalid, there is no where near it, no where have the price he gave us.

We went to one of the clinic he sent Onyuu we went there, Inae was in charge of talking as no one speak english either. The staff got us the thai/ english speakers so I can talk to them, they have never heard about SOKO, which could be that there are so many companies.
The experience with Mohit so far is horrible. I dont think it would be good if we continue with him.

We got to talk to the thai lady and she informed us that they accept more agencies but we must have a korean business registration.

We later decided that we wont be going to other clinics that Mohit sent becasue it is useless, they dont share prices if you dont get the procedures done.

### Clinic 4: AIVE Clinic

So I dd some research and found AIVE clinic, which has good reviews among thais. We went there but no thai speaking. However, some staff speak a bit of english and Inae was translating. This clinic we get to talk to get the consult with the doctor not a sales person, the doctor speaks english, there is a consultiton fee of 50,000 KRW if i ended up getting the procedure done, the fee is waved. I decided to get rejuran 2cc and skin botox, they offer free botox too if i give the review on gmap. This place they didnt do the skin scan. The service is good. They clean my face for me and the doctor is very nice and gentle. The price is good, not too cheap or too expensive. Nice looking and nice staff. 

## Conclusion

We got more with our own research than going through mohit which is quite disappointing. I think this would work if we do it ourselves not through mohit. His work style is too messy and unorganized. We need to find more details and do more research. I believed that this business could work and we could be successful with it. I worked in this industry for multiple years and i trust that I can make it work. Only we need to find the right partner to work with.
