Meeting agenda for Tanny and Inae's face-to-face debrief following their Korea exploration trip. This is the first of two debriefs — focused on alignment between Tanny and Inae before a broader discussion with all four founders. The core question: can Tanny and Inae align on the direction of GlowCheck and work together effectively?

## Meeting Goal

Confirm alignment between Tanny and Inae on GlowCheck's direction — specifically whether both are committed to the medical tourism business and agree on what needs to change to make it work.

## Agenda

### 1. Trip Debrief — What We Saw and Learned

**Purpose:** Start with the shared experience to build common ground.

Talking points:
- Walk through the clinic visits together — what worked, what didn't
- Doctor Designer Clinic: no English speakers, rough experience, confused about the booking, harsh botox injection with instant bruising — not a clinic we'd send customers to
- Vands Clinic: strong experience at both branches — English-speaking staff, skin analysis, knowledgeable explanations, Thai-speaking staff at Myeongdong branch. A promising partner option
- AIVE Clinic: good doctor consultation in English, gentle service, fair pricing — another strong candidate found through our own research
- Onyuu Clinic: no English, staff hadn't heard of SOKO, but confirmed agencies need Korean business registration
- Key takeaway to surface: **we got better results from our own research than from Mohit's coordination**

### 2. The Partner Situation — Mohit Is Not Working

**Purpose:** This is the critical alignment checkpoint. Tanny needs to be direct about why continuing with Mohit will kill the business.

Talking points:
- Mohit received the itinerary in advance but failed to book the three clinics we requested (YSLeeds, Dr. Go, Artisan Clinic)
- He sent last-minute alternatives with no information, no pricing, and no bookings
- He sent us to Doctor Designer Clinic where they expected 2 foreigners (passport confusion), had no English speakers, and the experience was rough
- He was largely unresponsive during the trip, citing an event he already knew about
- The prices he shared in advance were completely inaccurate — nowhere near what clinics actually charge
- **The bottom line:** if this is the experience we had as founders testing the process, it would be catastrophic for paying customers. People undergoing medical procedures in a foreign country need to feel safe, comfortable, and taken care of. Mohit cannot deliver that
- **The ask:** Are we aligned that we need to find a different partner? This is not optional if we want the business to succeed

### 3. This Business Can Work — Tanny's Conviction

**Purpose:** Establish Tanny's credibility and confidence. This isn't about one business being more important than the other — both ventures can succeed.

Talking points:
- The Korea trip brought back everything from Destination Beauty — the industry, the customer needs, the sales process. It's the same business, same dynamics
- Tanny was a top salesperson at DB for multiple years — she knows how to handle sales, customer experience, hand-holding patients through the process, logistics
- She knows exactly what the sales funnel needs to look like (high-trust, longer cycle, not e-commerce)
- She knows what customer experience needs to be designed (reassurance, comfort, handling stress in a foreign country)
- **This is not a side project.** This business can generate revenue faster and with less upfront investment. Both businesses (medical tourism and the app) can be profitable — there's no need to rank one above the other
- Frame it as: one unified plan with two branches, not two competing priorities

### 4. Roles and Responsibilities — Who Does What

**Purpose:** Start defining clear ownership so everyone can move with purpose. Keep this high-level for now — details will be refined in the full founders meeting.

Proposed ownership:
- **Tanny:** Sales, customer experience design, sales funnel, client hand-holding, logistics coordination. Leveraging her years of Destination Beauty expertise
- **Inae:** All Korea operations — partner research and relationships, on-the-ground coordination, market exploration (new clinics, new procedures, expanding the offering), business registration research
- **Julien:** Lead generation infrastructure, website, UX and conversion funnel, CRM and multi-channel communication setup (LINE, Facebook, IG, live chat), tech and tooling, AI workflow optimization
- **Zach:** Aligned with the plan; specific responsibilities to be defined in the full founders meeting

Key point: Inae's role is critical and high-impact — she is the only person who can handle the Korea side (language, relationships, local knowledge). If the Mohit question is resolved, Inae can immediately start contributing by researching proper partners.

### 5. Immediate Next Steps

**Purpose:** Leave the meeting with concrete actions, not just alignment in principle.

If aligned on Mohit and direction:
- [ ] Inae begins researching Korean partners — medical tourism agencies or clinics experienced with international patients (not random individuals)
- [ ] Inae researches Korean business registration requirements (needed to eventually hire someone on the ground)
- [ ] Tanny and Julien finalize and launch the website (even if design isn't perfect — iterate after launch)
- [ ] Pricing model needs to be defined (blocker for website launch)
- [ ] Plan the full four-founders meeting to formalize roles and the business plan

If not aligned:
- This is a fundamental question about whether the partnership works. If Inae is not open to moving away from Mohit, Tanny and Julien need to reassess whether the four-person founding team is viable

## Tone and Approach

- This should be face-to-face, one-on-one — not a group call
- Lead with the shared trip experience, not with criticism
- Frame as confidence and excitement ("I know how to make this work") rather than frustration
- Be direct about Mohit, but frame it as a business decision, not personal
- Emphasize partnership: "I need you for the Korea side — I can't do that part"
- Avoid framing one business as more important than the other
- The goal is to leave knowing: **are we on the same page?**
