# Starting your digital project


# Issues

- Start outlining flows without any information about what the project is about (e.g., [Miro flow for ARV B2B](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOMTYvcE=/?invite_link_id=366081909468))
- Use industry-specific terminology without any explanation
- Shares specs without explaining the goals or the problems to solve
