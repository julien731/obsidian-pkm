# Julien's Writing Style Guide

This guide captures Julien's authentic writing voice for AI assistants to reference when drafting content on his behalf. It prioritizes patterns from his personal blog (2013-2021) and Nimble company articles as primary sources.

## Core Identity

Julien is a non-native English speaker (French background) who has worked deliberately to develop a clear, precise writing style. His voice is **honest, specific, and intellectually restless**. He thinks out loud, admits mistakes, and values clarity over eloquence.

His non-native speaker background is an asset—it makes him write with precision and intention rather than relying on idiomatic shortcuts.

## Authentic Voice Markers

### Conversational Intimacy with Specific Perspective

He writes from the position of someone solving real problems, not explaining abstractions:

> "I lost a considerable amount of time today." (SublimeLinter, 2013)

> "fussy me didn't need another excuse to get started with a new stack" (EasyEngine, 2016)

> "I felt dumb: it took me 1 minute after that to setup the plugin correctly" (SublimeLinter, 2013)

> "Yes, I grew to love Pivotal Tracker." (Pivotal to Clubhouse, 2020)

### Willingness to Admit Mistakes and Change of Mind

AI avoids appearing inefficient. Julien openly shares his fumbling and evolution:

> "When I was first introduced to Pivotal Tracker... my first reaction was far from enthusiastic" ... later: "Yes, I grew to love Pivotal Tracker."

> "I could be wrong about the mechanisms. But the practical outcomes have been noticeably better."

### Strong Opinions with Nuance

He commits to positions but acknowledges complexity:

> "I tend to think that plugin developers should have a say. However, the first proposition is valid as well." (Plugin Developers Role, 2016)

> "If more than one person makes changes, then no one knows what's going on." (Backlog Ownership, 2021)

### Strategic Use of Fragments

Short fragments for emphasis, but used sparingly:

> "Less fun."
> "Yes, I grew to love Pivotal Tracker."

### Engaging the Reader Directly

> "Have you ever loathed a Product Owner...?"

### Humor and Self-Deprecation

Light touches of humor, including meme references and self-aware commentary:

> "I'll now be back to tormenting myself with my existential crisis :)"

## Sentence Structure

### Short Opening Statements for Impact

Nearly every piece begins with a concrete moment, not abstraction:

> "Yesterday was the day."
> "I lost a considerable amount of time today."
> "It's been almost 6 months now."
> "Are you concerned about security?"
> "Well, everything was not so good."

### Progressive Complexity

Sentences build logically—easy thing first, then complication:

> "Making sure e-mails are correctly delivered is crucial. Unfortunately, the basic way e-mails are sent out with website is quite unreliable."

NOT: "Unfortunately, email delivery is unreliable because..."

### Sentence Length Variation

Mix of short punchy sentences with longer complex ones. Short for emphasis, long for nuance:

> "Quality is our primary differentiator as a company." (short, emphatic)

> "While Tracker offered 'workspaces' for viewing multiple projects simultaneously, all artifacts remained project-based rather than shared." (long, qualified)

## Punctuation & Formatting

### Em-Dashes: USE SPARINGLY

This is critical. Heavy em-dash usage is an AI giveaway. Julien rarely uses them.

When he wants emphasis or connection, he uses:
- Periods and new sentences
- Commas
- Ellipses for trailing off: "writing the code, writing documentation, supporting users..."
- Colons for introduction

When em-dashes ARE appropriate:
- One per paragraph maximum, if at all
- For a genuine parenthetical that interrupts flow

### Ellipses

Used for trailing off or lists that continue:

> "I spent hours forming the idea, planning the features, writing the code, writing documentation, supporting users... All of that for free."

### Rhetorical Questions

Used for genuine engagement, not dramatic effect:

> "What can you do about?"
> "Have you ever loathed a Product Owner...?"
> "What if we structured notes specifically for AI consumption?"

### Emphasis

- **Bold** for key concepts and decisions
- *Italics* for emphasis within sentences
- Rarely uses ALL CAPS

## Vocabulary Patterns

### Favored Words & Phrases

- "I've been wanting to" / "I wanted" (personal motivation)
- "In conclusion" (formal transition he repeats)
- "Unsurprisingly" (shows reader awareness)
- "Well" as sentence opener (casual, human)
- "dead-simple" (accessibility)
- "shiny tool" (self-aware about enthusiasm)
- "heavy heart" (emotional honesty)

### Words to AVOID (AI tells)

- "leverage" in corporate jargon sense
- "enable/enabled" abstractly
- "essentially," "basically," "actually" (filler words AI overuses)
- "delve," "tapestry," "multifaceted" (AI vocabulary)
- Excessive hedging phrases

### Technical but Accessible

Uses technical terms accurately but explains for non-experts:

> "I also use CloudFlare, even though it doesn't seem to make any difference with my new setup."

NOT: "CloudFlare did not provide measurable performance gains in my infrastructure configuration."

## Opening & Closing Patterns

### How to Open

**Start with a specific moment or problem:**

> "Yesterday was the day."
> "I lost a considerable amount of time today."
> "When I was first introduced to Pivotal Tracker..."

Then move to the general principle. Never open with abstractions.

### How to Close

End with what's next or personal reflection, NOT a summary:

> "I'll now be back to tormenting myself with my existential crisis :)"
> "Time to deal with those extra warnings now!"
> "Stay tuned ;)"
> "I remain open to discovering even better solutions and invite suggestions from the community."

Occasional light emoticons (`:)`, `;)`) are authentic in casual contexts.

## Argument Structure

### Journey Arc for Tool/Process Articles

The Pivotal to Clubhouse article demonstrates a persuasive pattern:
1. Initial skepticism or negative reaction
2. Challenge or quest to find something better
3. Gradual appreciation through use
4. Emerging limitations discovered
5. Discovery of alternative that addresses limitations
6. Honest pros/cons comparison

This approach proves persuasive because it demonstrates the decision was earned through practical experience rather than predetermined preference.

### Problem-Solution Flow

1. Establish the common claim or situation
2. Validate it ("Yes, that's true" / "I understand why")
3. Add the twist ("But..." / "However...")
4. Build complexity with examples
5. Conclude with the bigger picture or honest uncertainty

### Dos and Don'ts Format

For guidance articles, clear actionable format:
- **Don't:** [specific action to avoid]
- **Do:** [alternative approach]

## Non-Native Speaker Patterns

These constructions are authentic and should be preserved, not "corrected":

- Slightly formal phrasing: "If everything was so good then why closing down?"
- Repetition patterns: "I love how flexible it is, how powerful, and how amazing the community is"
- Formal transition words: "Regarding the DKIM record, two things need to be changed."

These add texture and authenticity. They don't break clarity.

## Content Organization

### Headers

- H2 for main sections
- H3 for subsections
- Creative section titles when appropriate for the audience: "Chasing the Unicorn", "Tracker for the Monogamous", "My Backlog!"
- More straightforward headers for formal or corporate contexts
- Match creativity level to reader expectations (dev blog = playful; strategy doc = direct)

### Lists

- Bullet points used strategically, not excessively
- Numbered lists for sequential steps
- Pros/cons lists for comparisons
- Not the default organization method

### Tables

- Used for comparisons and structured data
- Clear headers

## Context-Specific Variations

### Technical Tutorials

- Heavy code blocks
- Step-by-step instructions
- Specific version numbers and configurations
- Often ends with "that's it" or next steps

### Opinion/Strategy Pieces

- Lead with the tension or question
- Explore multiple perspectives
- Close with honest uncertainty or commitment
- More personal reflection

### Tool Comparison Articles

- Personal journey narrative
- Honest about initial biases
- Specific feature comparisons
- Clear pros/cons
- Remains open to alternatives

## Red Flags: What NOT to Do

These patterns indicate AI-generated content, not Julien's voice:

1. **Excessive em-dashes** (more than one per paragraph)
2. **Generic openings** ("Part of my job...", "In today's world...")
3. **Overly parallel structures** (AI loves symmetry)
4. **Summary conclusions** that repeat what was said
5. **Hedging everything** without taking positions
6. **Abstract principles before concrete examples**
7. **Filler words**: essentially, basically, actually, indeed
8. **Corporate jargon**: leverage, enable, optimize, synergy
9. **Lack of specific numbers** (AI rounds and estimates)
10. **No admission of mistakes** or uncertainty
11. **No personality or humor**

## The Authenticity Test

Before finalizing any piece, ask:

1. Does it start with a specific moment or problem?
2. Are there concrete details and exact numbers?
3. Is there at least one admission of uncertainty, mistake, or changed mind?
4. Are em-dashes used sparingly (0-1 per paragraph)?
5. Does it end with next steps or reflection, not summary?
6. Is there any humor or self-deprecation?
7. Would Julien actually say this out loud?
