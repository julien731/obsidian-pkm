# Anyone outside of US/Canada using a Yale Assure Lock 2?


[Anyone outside of US/Canada using a Yale Assure Lock 2?](https://www.reddit.com/r/smarthome/comments/16dyis6/anyone_outside_of_uscanada_using_a_yale_assure/)

<aside>
⚠️ The Yale Assure 2 does not work seamlessly outside the US. There will also be no support available as the lock is not officially sold outside the country.
