## Summary

The HFT Guy figured out how to run gigabit ethernet over existing phone wires using German adapters from GigaCopper. Phone wires work much better than power lines (less electrical noise), but almost no manufacturers make products for this use case.

## Key Points

- UK homes are full of phone sockets but have zero ethernet wiring
- Standard powerline adapters (G.hn 2400) max out around 180 Mbps in practice
- The same G.hn technology works on any wire pair — phone wires are actually better
- **GigaCopper** (German company) makes adapters specifically for phone wire networking
- Order from Amazon DE or eBay DE, ships internationally
