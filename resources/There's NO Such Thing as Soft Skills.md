# There's NO Such Thing as "Soft Skills"


- Performance vs. trust
- High performance, low trust → toxic
- Better have a medium performance, high trust person
- Ask the team "who the asshole is" and ask "who on the team will always be there for you"

> I'm a big fan of peer reviews

- Human skills, not soft skills
