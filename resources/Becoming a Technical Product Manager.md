# Becoming a Technical Product Manager


# What is a Product Manager

## What is a Technical Product Manager

It's a PM who basically can code; at least a little.

## Why Becoming a Technical Product Manager

- Better understanding of how products get created
- Better understanding and relationship with the devs
- Ability to do more legwork and POCs

# Working with Software Engineers

All PMs work with software engineers to some extent. Technical PMs, though, can create a strong relationship with the SE by understanding them, talking their language, and protecting them more.

This leads to better products (though better collaboration with devs) and better output (through more efficiency thanks to planning for example).

## Forming a Strong Relationship

# Stakeholders Management as a Technical Product Manager

Always assume that you're wrong, listen, then demonstrate that you're right.

Don't be obnoxious with your tech knowledge (e.g., know it all)

Defend with data (when someone won't hear you dive deep and corner them)

Use yes or no questions to show your reasoning and to defend when necessary.

Assessing and estimating projects (remember the conversation with Sam about the Omise CMS project estimation)

Building (mental) models and abstraction (e.g., Joseph about the Stripe training: ["just a heads up that I have no experience with Stripe. But I am excited to be doing the training!"](https://nimble-co.slack.com/archives/G01PZGE61MJ/p1630288933000100) but he knows this type of technology.
