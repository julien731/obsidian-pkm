# 5 onboarding best practices for product management leaders


You won’t truly align new hires to a product vision and mission if you don’t write it out for yourself at the outset of your search. I call these “success briefs,” and they get everyone else in your team (and possibly the wider organization) on the same page regarding:

- Why this person is being brought on
- What they’ll be working on
- Who they’ll need to meet and work with
- How we’ll know if they’re successful
- How we’ll keep them (and ourselves as managers) accountable
