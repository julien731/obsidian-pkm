# What’s the Right Way to Clean, Condition & Protect Your Leather? Meguiar’s – Quik Tips


- Most leather car seats are vinyl-coated.
- It is important to use a vinyl-specific cleaner in this case. A raw leather cleaner will not penetrate the vinyl layer, or it could damage it.
- Is the leather vinyl coated? Drop a drop of water on it. If the drop sinks in, it's raw leather. If it doesn't, it's vinyl coated.
