# Design Brief


# House Purpose

This house will be used as a weekend gateway and a vacation retreat.

It's a house meant to disconnect you from work and the stress from urban life. It's a retreat where you can reconnect with yourself and with nature thanks to a minimalist design

# Why Bang Kachao

Bang Kachao is a hidden oasis in the middle of a bustling city.

It's a fantastic green area that feels so remote and yet is so close to Bangkok. Its local attractions like the floating market, bicycle tours, and park, make it a perfect spot for a vacation far away from the city, and yet it takes less than an hour to get there from Bangkok.

# Experience First

The focus of this house is the experience. It is comfortable and provides all the luxuries expected from the city workers, but it is not meant to be a place where you stay indoors.

Besides the proximity to Bang Kachao attractions, the house itself is an attraction. Its modern and unique design gives guests a luxury jungle experience. The outdoor landscaping and amenities (pool, barbecue, photo spots, lounge areas) provide everything guests need to spend a recharging few days in the jungle.

# Requirements

## Modern & Natural

The design should be modern and integrated to nature. It's a jungle house so plants and green in general are essential throughout the house.

Ideally, blending interior and exterior would provide the ultimate feeling of nature *but* in a luxurious way.

There should also be plenty of natural light coming inside the house.

## Materials

This list of material is not a precise requirement. Rather, it is a list of preferences aand we are open to using some of it, all of it, or even other material if it makes sense in the design.

- Concrete (polished)
- Wood
- Metal

## Amenities

- Living area with TV
- Kitchen with sink, stove, and storage
- Bathroom with comfortably sized shower
- Bedroom with small storage and king size bed
- Small storage room inside to store pillows, towels, and small stuff
- Storage room outside to store larger items (e.g., bed sheets) and cleaning supply

## Dimensions

The project is a tiny house to it needs to be small and very well organized. The house shoud be 60 sqm or less.

The swimming pool should be 3 x 6 m maximum.

We'd like the house to be 2 storeys but we are open to other suggestions as long as they look great.

## Exterior

The exterior is just as important as the interior in this tiny house, experience-oriented project.

The exterior needs to provide the same level of comfort as the interior.

- Louge area; covered (to protect from the sun) with a fan
- Barbecue area
- Swimming pool

There must be unique spots that will be perfect for family and friends to snap Instagram photos.
