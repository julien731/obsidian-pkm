# Catch-up with Carlos

# Request for Feedback

- Commercial stuff is not moving:
    - Loyalty demo → CBTL is currently blocked for any new market.
    - What else do you feel is not moving?
- What skills do you need from me that you feel you're not getting?
- What other things/activities do you feel are not moving fast enough?
- Business networks.
- What is, as of today, your ideal outcome for Nimble?

# Company Setup

- Where are we at? When can we update the HK shareholders agreement?
- We need to push harder now for the JFC contract. It's taking an unreasonable amount of time. We have a massive risk.

# Feedback

## JFC/Jollibee

- It seems that there is a stronger internal push towards outsourcing.
    - Sarwar: likes working with us (the relationship has improved) but he feels like we’re too expensive.
    - Marcos and Kevin have been asked why they don’t outsource more (e.g. to Vietnam).

## Martin

- Lack of hands-on work.
- Lack of attention to details & polish.
- Tendency to take credit for others’ work?
- What has he achieved so far? (Genuine question.)
