# Client Responsibilities

See [Client Responsibilities Documentation](https://www.notion.so/Client-Responsibilities-Documentation-0d6d9eca0adc4dc787ebe96f1baf680b?pvs=21) 

- "Recipe for Success"
- "Conditions for success"

# Getting the Client On-Board

- Why are we telling them about their responsibilities? **So that they can best use us.**
- Our strength is our team and our processes. Every time a client takes a piece away from us, they hinder our high level of performance.

# Requirements

- It needs to be very concise and straight to the point. It's the *one* document that we really need clients to read.

# Notes

- Text content vs. FAQ style. What is the most interactive?
- What is an efficient way to pass requirements?
- Quick feedback is needed.
- Agree with the client on the sprint duration?
- Unannounced API changes.
- Add client testing responsibilities to Compass
- Add scope type (for requirements gathering) to the process and project
    - This could vary the timeline (i.e., how early we need to get the requirements)

- Slow feedback
- Unannounced API changes
- Requirements shared late
