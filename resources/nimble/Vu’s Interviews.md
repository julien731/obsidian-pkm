# Vu’s Interviews

- October 16, 2024 - Laurent CAMPMAS
    - A little bit robotic in the intro. You need to get more familiar and comfortable with the process.
    - Need to dive deeper when answers are superficial/high level. Started doing it question 5.
    - Avoid the “what else” follow up questions (e.g., q6). Keep things open yet precise. For example: what does a user story look like? Is there anything else you’d typically ask?
- October 18, 2024 - Huynh Thi Ngoc Dung
    - Nice way to destress the candidate at the start.
    - More fluid intro compared to last time.
- January 16, 2025 - Massimiliano Locci
    - Question 2: was it really worth following up (and extending the interview)?
