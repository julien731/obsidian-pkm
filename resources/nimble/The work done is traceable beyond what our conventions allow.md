# The work done is traceable beyond what our conventions allow

Area: Backlog Management (../Product%20Track%20Areas/Backlog%20Management%20d6060c164abb4d31a0d32d54138a2b93.md)

Each project has needs that are specific and cannot be covered by our base conventions. For any given project, the work done should be traceable from many different standpoints. Product Managers should always be able to easily surface how much effort was spent, when, and the context around it for unpredictable situations. For example.

- When a client requests new, unplanned work.
- When work gets created because of an issue on the application.
- Work that is cross-modules and/or cross-features (hence not traceable using only our base conventions).
