# Got’s Presentation

- Tell people what's going on when you're working on something (e.g., getting the device connected).
- Take people's attention back after you've been busy with something (example above).
- Don't talk about scope with this crowd. They don't know what it means. Just answer the questions for what's possible now.
- You need to be more story telling oriented to keep people's attention rather that thinking about flows.
- When you create documents on G Drive make sure to create in the appropriate folder, not in your personal Drive.
