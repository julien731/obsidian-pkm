- Ordering sequence: what if no delivery driver is found once the food is ready at the restaurant?
- Why didn’t you use a database for user stories, requirements, and releases? You have a lot of duplicated content.
- User stories need to be more business value-oriented.
- What exactly are the available promotion mechanics for the MVP? Just a flat rate and % off?
    - How confident are you with your timeline?
    - What team structure would you need for that to happen?

# Misc

- MBA: when will you complete it? Can you manage your time?
