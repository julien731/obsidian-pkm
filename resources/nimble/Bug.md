# Bug

Description: A bug arises when something in an already implemented user story does not behave as expected.

Note: if something does not behave as expected before a user story has been accepted, it is not considered a bug but simply a user story which did not pass QA and needs rework.
Example: Email addresses with the .co extension don't pass email validation
Jira Naming: Bug
