# NY 2023 Speech

Hi, everyone! Thank you for joining us to celebrate the New Year. I hope you’re all having a good time. I’m looking forward to seeing who will end up hugging the toilet tonight. We had a few memorable moments last time. You know who you are… Julien.

Seriously, though. Thank you, everyone, for your hard work last year.

It wasn’t an easy year. We’ve had lots of challenges along the way. We've been working with

- very tight timelines,
- changing requirements,
- surprise specs coming from QA teams,
- building an entire ledger system last-minute...

We have adapted and delivered—every time. Thanks to everyone's hard work and focus on finding solutions.

We need to continue on that path in 2023, and we need to double-down on our core values. It’s what makes us unique. Having a strong sense of ownership, aiming for excellence… Those are the things that enable us to do great work.

I read an article a little while back that resonated a lot. It's from a former Stripe employee, and she talks about an interaction she had with a friend. Here is what it says:

*A few months ago, someone complained to me that the new startup they were at had a “lgtm culture.” Upon inquiry, they explained that no matter what they do or how good it is, everyone just says “looks good to me.” “I know I should feel good about being a competent, trusted, contributing team member,” he continued, “and my new colleagues are so kind, but at the end of the day I just feel like no one has any standards.” He looked down at his coffee for a moment. “I’m afraid I’m never going to see my best work again.”*

We should all be critical of ourselves and our teammates. Keeping each other to high standards is not only doing right by your teammates; it enables them to do their best work.

With those last words, have a fantastic evening, everyone, and drink resonably... or don't!
