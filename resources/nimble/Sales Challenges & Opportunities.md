# Sales Challenges & Opportunities

My general opinion is that Fair’s work is more akin to that of [an SDR](https://www.pipedrive.com/en/blog/sales-development-rep) than a salesperson.

> Simply put, SDRs do the initial work so other salespeople can approach qualified leads. The role is usually an entry-level position that doesn’t require years of experience, making it a good way to start in sales.

## What Went Well

- Fair seems able to establish good connections with the leads.
- She can be very quick in fetching answers from the leads when necessary (she’ll often just give them a phone call on the spot).
- She seems able to extract valuable sales-related information from leads such as expectations for proposals although it sometimes requires prompting her to do so. This is an area where I feel should could easily bring mure value by doing it consistently.

## Challenges

### Lack of Strategy

I never see any plan or strategy on how to pitch new leads to win.

It’s usually only about scope, man-days, cost. It’s a shame that there is not more thoughts on *how* to approach each lead, especially as Fair seems to be able to gather a lot of insights from her contacts but I don’t see it translated into a pitching plan.

### Lack of Initial Information & Clarity

- Example: Gulf wood prices project [Lead Intent Statement](https://www.notion.so/Lead-Intent-Statement-5fb368aad65748a98641074178b2dbf9?pvs=21)
    - The pain points are not actionable
    - No information about what they want to build (or what problem they need to solve)
    - The “budget concerns” constraints is not actionable
- Example: Bumrungrad [Bumrungrad - Mobile App ](https://www.notion.so/Bumrungrad-Mobile-App-1a70432ffb4147cb966f9d6cdeb5abb4?pvs=21)
    - No information whatsoever

### Short Timeframes

- Example: SCG [SCG Prompt Plus (Sub Dealer Module)](https://www.notion.so/SCG-Prompt-Plus-Sub-Dealer-Module-3f9bbaac65704c388420be382277e37f?pvs=21)
    - Lead document shared on April 3rd.
    - Client meeting on April 7.
    - Proposal expected on April 18. That’s 8 business days for discovery and proposal preparation.
- Example: GSB [Lead Intent Statement](https://www.notion.so/Lead-Intent-Statement-18f8f2cde15147f0a7b4fa436f1c5554?pvs=21)
    - [Scope finalization on March 28](https://nimble-co.slack.com/archives/C04AJEG3CK1/p1679986146633679) with a proposal expected on March 31st (got extended later).
    - [Lack of updates and clarity on what is needed next for the proposal/presentation](https://nimble-co.slack.com/archives/C04AJEG3CK1/p1681176401442959).

### Lack of Materials Preparation

- Meeting agenda/notes are rarely prepared in advance.
- [The SOW documents often consist of just creating a new file from the SOW template](https://nimble-co.slack.com/archives/C04QE7UAZEY/p1679481310848699) without any additional content.

# Opportunities

- Leverage Fair’s ability to extract commercial information from the leads to establish a pitching plan for each project (e.g., what does matter to the client? who has personal agendas and would benefit from the project? how do we articulate our message to ensure that it gives the sponsors what they want?).
- Establish a clear timeline for a lead’s milestones (e.g., intro meeting, proposal submission, presentation) from the very beginning in a way that everyone can consult.
    - Better follow-ups and updates from Fair about discovery/features listing progress and new or changing information from clients.
