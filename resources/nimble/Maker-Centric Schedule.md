# Maker-Centric Schedule

Inspired by [https://blog.nuclino.com/makers-don-t-let-yourself-be-forced-into-the-manager-schedule](https://blog.nuclino.com/makers-don-t-let-yourself-be-forced-into-the-manager-schedule)

- Let's try a schedule that's focused on "Makers" instead of managers.
- Switch from synchronous to asynchronous chats
- Setup a process for asking questions asynchronously
- Set very clear goals to any given meeting and don't deviate
