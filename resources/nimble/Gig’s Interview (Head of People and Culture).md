# Gig’s Interview (Head of People and Culture)

# Notes

- She doesn’t listen very well. Answers too fast and not on point.
- Deal with rejection: ask why? Understand the reason. Learn for next time. However, there are cases where there is a legal component (labor law).
- Events:
    - Birthdays/anniversaries
    - Townhall
    - Events (new year, etc)
    - Bring a senior person to share an achievement/success story. How do you find it: ask management.
    - Largest event: new year. 100-ish people.
    - Rely on a “committee” made of other people in the company. No experience organizing large events on her own.
