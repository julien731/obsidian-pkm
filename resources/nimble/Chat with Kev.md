# Chat with Kev

- General catch-up on how everything’s going.
- CBTL
    - We are not making progress. What’s the status with all the changes we’ve been discussing and can we take more ownership, at least until CBTL has time to find the right people.
    - Example: we are leaving a lot of money on the table for delivery and there doesn’t seem to be any urgency for this.
- Smashburger
    - We are dealing with a lot of questions that shouldn’t be for developers with some level of seniority.

    - Worrying practices. To remove some errors that were happening, they just changed some variable names and hardcoded values in the codebase.
- Jollibee
    - How are things going with the launch?
    - What are the stability issues that I’ve been hearing about?
    - Any way we can accelerate the rollout/transition from Tillster? We are ready and eager.
    - Loyalty workshop: is this confirmed so that I can organize with my team.
    - Delivery orders → dual webhooks delivered + cancelled. It’s because the drivers click delivered right away for SLAs.
        - Do you get charged for a refund?
- Okya
    - What’s the feedback?
    - What’s the idea with the master menu?
