# Devs, PMs, and Estimations

- PMs need estimations to know what to tell clients
- If something doesn't seem feasible in the timeframe required, **PMs will fight for the team and push back with the client**
- If devs are just yes-men then they actually hurt themselves because the PM will *not* push back with the client
- PMs are your friends. They are the ones fighting for you, defending you when necessary, and leading battles with the clients to keep a sane development rythm.
- Talk to your PM if you have doubts, concerns, or worries. Your PM will *always* be available for you, listen to you, and do whatever is in their power to help.
