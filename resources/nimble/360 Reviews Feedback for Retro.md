# 360 Reviews Feedback for Retro

- Only 1 person submitted their feedback
- Before we start: does anyone who didn’t submit their forms have a good reason for not having done so?
- Why is it a problem?
    - Demonstrates poor professional skills
        - PM should demonstrate way better organization skills. Engineers are doing better.
    - Nimble puts a lot of effort into personal growth and everyone’s help is needed. By not providing feedback you are essentially slowing down the growth of your colleagues.
        - They do the same for you. Engineers spend time sharing their feedback so that you can learn what are your areas of improvement and your areas of strength.
- Does anyone have a problem with this feedback model?
    - If you have a problem with this model but don’t feel like sharing publicly please come talk to me.
- This is very disappointing and it reflects very poorly on the entire Product chapter.
- I don’t want to see this happen again. You must take this very seriously.
    - If you have feedback to share about making the process somehow better not is the time.
