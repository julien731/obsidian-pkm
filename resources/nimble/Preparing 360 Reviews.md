# Preparing 360 Reviews

1. Review team feedback and summarize
2. Review self-assessment and compare with team (and your own) feedback
3. For PMs: review the past sprints in their backlog
    1. Pick some random user stories. Are they well written? Is the format good? Do they make sense? Are all the naming standards (e.g., title, epic, labels)?
    2. Check how much work is ready in the backlog. It should be at least 2 sprints.
    3. Check the cycle time for the past sprints. It should be around 2-3 days. Beyond that, check if QA is done on time. Beyond that, it could be on the development side.
4. Check the previous 360 "what could be better" and compare with current feedback
5. Check objectives. Were they completed?
