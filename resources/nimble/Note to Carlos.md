# Note to Carlos

Hey, Carlos. There's a couple of random thoughts I wanted to share based on topics we've discussed and went through recently.

# Rose

We talked about moving CRM to Notion. I think we should keep a proper CRM tool just to have the means to track sales activities (incl. emails).
We need to enforce the use of the CRM/tracking emails/registering contacts and deals with any new person in a sales-related role. This should be part of passing probation, too.

# Trung

I'm concerned with his attitude. I feel like he's more interested in pursuing his own agenda rather than further the company's development. Tanny told me she asked him whether he's coming to the anniversary party and "he's not sure yet" instead of showing the example and motivating his team. His answer was "why don't we go there instead" showing a place which seems closer to his home (maybe a coincidence, not impossible). It's not the first time I see this kind of attitude.
He's not careful enough with his work. He pushed some updates to Centauri production without code review and proper testing. While those updates are small, Centauri is the foundation for invoicing. If the data is wrong we can lose money.

How is it going with him? He's a very nice guy but I'm not seeing much impact from him at the moment. I might just not be seeing it so no strong judgment here and I'm curious to hear your thoughts.
