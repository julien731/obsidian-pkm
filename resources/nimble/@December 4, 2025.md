## Project Updates

### Jollibee

- Supposedly kick off Jollibee Vietnam in January 2026. Got this from Kevin. He would like to have Vu join. Probably in HCMC.
- The loyalty program will start in Feb. However, the Jollibee team already shared a timeline (with 4 months for implementation) while we don’t even have clear requirements. It’s unlikely to take only 4 months. Already raised this to Kevin. Vu and Julien are preparing an assessment but we’re also waiting for clear specs from Jollibee (acknowledged by Cin).
- Shared the Jollibee Global addendum with Kevin (for 2026).

### Okya AI

- Solid progress with the AI chatbot. Almost done with the “tenant plug-and-play” part which will make it easy to connect the flow to new tenants for various demos.
- At this stage, we should start thinking about building the full product. We should be able to get it done within a month or two.
