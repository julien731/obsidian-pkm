# Kafka Email

Hi, Dan, Grant, and team.

The Kafka integration has been already tested on and we need to connect it to your Kafka Rest Proxy. Could you please send over the REST proxy URL as well as credentials if there is basic auth in place. With that we can finalize the setup.

Please also see a demo of the integration below:

Best,
Carlos
