# Flexi Payroll Retrospective

## What Didn’t Go So Well

- Unclear project scope
- No escalation from the Product team when the scope wasn’t clear
- No escalation from the Product team when the client’s expectations grew bigger
- Deviations from the design process without escalation (i.e., UX flows with way too much detail)
- Initial technical setup was not focused on the actual needs of the project and timeline
- Junior (and new to the company) designer started the project
- Junior Product Manager was assigned independently
