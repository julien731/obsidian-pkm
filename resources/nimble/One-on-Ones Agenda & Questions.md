# One-on-Ones Agenda & Questions

# One-on-One Meeting Structure

The one-on-one meetings should be scheduled for 45 minutes. The 15 minutes to complete the hour can then be used to either write down the meeting summary, observations, and commitments —if any— or, if necessary, to expand on a lengthy topic.

In any case, if the meeting is going to take more than one hour then a separate meeting should be scheduled to discuss the topic requiring additional attention. This is so that other one-on-ones don't suffer from rescheduling.

## Scheduling

<aside>
💡 All one-on-one meetings should be scheduled as recurring meetings every two weeks.

</aside>

1. Define the main goal(s) of that specific one-on-one. The goal(s) must be selected from the types listed in the "Questions" table.
2. Select one/two questions from each type from the "Questions" table.
3. Create a new one-on-one report (TBD.)
4. Share the one-on-one agenda with the employee.
