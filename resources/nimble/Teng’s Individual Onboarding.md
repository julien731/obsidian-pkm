# Teng’s Individual Onboarding

# Why we're bringing you onboard

Nimble is a growing company. We are working with more and more clients, and the projects that we lead are increasingly complex. It creates a need for more UX/UI Design power, and this is where you come in: we need more Designers to satisfy more clients.

# What you'll be working on

You will be working on both internal and external (client) project. As part of those projects

# Who you'll need to meet and work with

It is essential that you feel comfortable reaching out to the entire team and feel confident asking for advice or direction from other Designers and Product Managers.

Looking at the team as a whole, you can find the list of people that you'll need to meet and eventually work with on Notion: [https://www.notion.so/nimblehq/Product-cb014346962e4dc88bd08b1a9ecaa60d](https://www.notion.so/Mission-Control-cb014346962e4dc88bd08b1a9ecaa60d?pvs=21) 

# How we'll know if you are successful

There is a lot that goes into becoming a successful Product Manager. Looking at your specific profile and personality, here are the expectations for your success:

- You will have a deep and comprehensive understanding of the Nimble Product Management process within the first month.
- You will be able to report and triage bugs appropriately within the first month.
- You will have passed the AWS Cloud Practitioner certification within the first two months.
- You will understand the fundamental differences between web, iOS, and Android within the first two months.
- You will write clear documents (with good English writing and grammar) within the first three months.
- You will be able to write clear and actionable user stories within the first three months.

# How we'll keep you (and ourselves) accountable

The success criteria might look challenging (and I hope it does, a challenge is good!) but remember: you're not alone.

You will have weekly 1-on-1 sessions with the CPO and plenty of opportunities to ask questions and seek guidance.

Those 1-on-1 sessions are also the opportunity for *you* to ensure that you get what you need to succeed, whether it is knowledge, guidance, or else.
