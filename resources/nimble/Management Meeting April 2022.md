# Management Meeting April 2022

- Hire a marketing person (see https://nimble-co.slack.com/archives/GE7RBLY6A/p1648525245813549)
- Product warranty & assignments: some projects have a warranty period but we generally don’t have anyone actually available (re-assigned after the end of a project). It can result in delays on the projects that are actually billed when a dev gets back to their previous project to investigate a bug.
    - The team has no visibility on what are the expectations and what are their duties in a warranty period. I can create an initiative but we need alignment on what and how to communicate.
