# Operations Order Template

# Objective

*Describe what we are aiming to achieve with this project. For example:*

*We are building a system that enables the client to provide an end-to-end loyalty system management. Their own clients will be able to manage their customers (via a CRM system), manage rewards, and manage segments used to offer specific rewards to targeted groups of customers.*

*This product will enable small and large companies to develop loyalty programs effortlessly and they will also become part of a lager loyalty network because each user of the platform will be automatically part of the overall network, enabling cross-merchants integrations in a breeze. This will lead to merchants being able to transfer points and rewards between them.*

## End State

*Give a clear and practical description of what the completed project (or at least completed as per the initial requirements) looks like. For example:*

*We will have two mobile applications: one iOS and one Android. We will also have an API, which the two mobile apps will rely on. Finally, we will have an administrative interface where the client can manage the content.*

# Vision

*Explain the client's vision for this product. Why are they doing this? Which problem are they trying to solve? Which market are they trying to penetrate? For example:*

*In those times of increased online browsing, shopping, working, and connecting, loyalty is becoming a must for more and more retail companies.*

*However, there is no easy solution that can be deployed to cover most use-cases. Instead, loyalty management solutions are often legacy software, difficult to customize, difficult to integrate (which is critical for retailers who work with thousands of different hardware like POS).*

*The vision for this project is to create a truly flexible system that can be extended with ease, has solid APIs to connect to any existing software and hardware used by customers, can be deployed easily, and can be customized to match the customers' needs with little effort.*

# Target Audience

*Explain who will use this product. For example:*

*This product will be used mostly by medium and large retailers but it can also be adopted by small players. The people actually using the application will be sales (CRM), support (ticketing), and marketing (loyalty, communication) people.*

*In large companies, those people are often not tech savvy so having a great UX is critical.*

# Reference Points

*In this section, list down competitors and aspirations. For each, explain what's good, which we can look up to, and what's bad, which we need to avoid. For example:*

## Competitors

- *Competitor 1*
    - *Massive scalability issues with high volumes*
- *Competitor 2*
    - *The system is very inflexible and forces only specific use-cases (which leads to lots of hacks to try and please the customer)*

## Aspirations

- *Aspiration 1*
    - *Extremely flexible and extensible*
- *Aspiration 2*
    - *Strong deployment process*

# Project Type

*Define whether the project is open-scope or closed-scope. This will help understand where to put the focus on the Product Management side: official scope and change requests (as defined in the SOW, for closed-scope) or delivery and resources (for open-scope).*

# Timeline

*Set out the overall timeline. If there are specific things that can add value to your timeline add them too.*

# Constraints

*If there are constraints that we need to work within then they should be outlined here. For example:*

# Team

*Explain the team breakdown and list who's on the team. For example:*

## Web/API

- *Team member 1*
- *Team member 2*
- *Team member 3*

## iOS

- *Team member 4*
- *Team member 5*

## Android

- *Team member 6*
- *Team member 7*

# Friendly Forces

*If there are other parties that we will be working with on the project then detail it here. Explain who's who and who's doing what. For example:*

*We will be working with two parties on this project in addition to the client:*

- *Party 1: they will handle the program management office (PMO)*
- *Party 2: they will handle one of the core APIs that we will need to use in the mobile apps. Our API team will create a gateway to abstract this additional, third-party API.*

# Possible Issues

*Describe the possible issues and challenges of the project if any. It can be technical issues (working with a complex or outdated system), project management issues, or anything else that could potentially slow down the team and add extra efforts.*
