# Empowering employees to deliver for more value (more freedom to experiment)

# Problem Statement

Joseph, Julien, and David brought up the idea of [Live Activities](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/live-activities). This demonstrates a certain level of ownership & engagement with the project.

- **What happened with this?** Nothing, and those people probably feel unheard 👎
- What should happen instead?
    1. **Allow them to work on it** (e.g., can you deliver that POC if you spend some time across two sprints?)
    2. **Allow for real and direct cross-functional collaboration** without following the working processes (engineers to work directly with designers… create a slack channel just for the POC? Centralize the information in Notion in the way you want? Do a prototype in Figma?

# POC ideas to explore

- How to push users to do specific actions to increase time to checkout ([Slack message](https://nimble-co.slack.com/archives/C05PYU3HB51/p1722423393452289))
    - Tools: [Remote Config personalization](https://firebase.google.com/docs/remote-config/personalization)?
    - Let interested people define the assumptions & solutions.
        - Let the designers devise it:
            - When to trigger the prompt?
            - How often to repeat the prompt?
            - On which screen to show it?
        - Let’s the engineers
- **Context**: How can we help users to purchase their favorite food (personalization)?
    - Tools: Okya order data?
    - What’s the best UX for it?
