# Notes

- Minor SSO
    - Working internally on the technical solution.
    - They need to have more clarity on their technical solution before engaging with a vendor.
- Bonchon
    - Will be discussed next week.
    - Budget is still a concern for them.
    - Might need a warranty on the work that we would deliver.
        - Expectation around 1 month.
- 1112D redesign
    - Initiative is from Peter.
    - This year’s budget is pretty much out.
    - They want to check how much traffic the website gets to see if it’s worth redesigning.
