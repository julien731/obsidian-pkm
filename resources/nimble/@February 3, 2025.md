- Coming to interview while he’s “working from home”??
- Lacks confidence. Speaks so low that I struggled to hear him over the fan noise.
- Talked about using AI. Interesting talk but then he mentioned that he only goes so far because he has the free plans only and then the CTO takes over with a paid plan to do some POCs.

- No structure. The interview had no logic. Very hard to assess the candidate.
- We have a form, yet she barely followed the questions.
- No dynamism in the interview. No leadership. Ra
