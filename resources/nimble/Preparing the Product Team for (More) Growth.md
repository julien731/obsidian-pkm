# Preparing the Product Team for (More) Growth

Hi, guys.

My peak workload with the Minor CEP project is now behind me and I am regaining more control over my schedule. This gives me the opportunity to restart some initiatives that are currently on hold and to initiate new ones.

Given the upcoming growth of the Product team, and with the experience of the previous rapid growth phase which was quite rocky, I am planning on tackling a number of high-priority initiatives to make future growth more sustainable and to provide a better experience to new joiners.

The goals that I want to achieve through those initiatives are the following:

- Start hiring junior PMs and train them
- Improve the onboarding experience
- Increase the PM training capabilities
- Give a clearer development path to PMs with better self-improvement guidance

I expect to achieve those goals by completing a series of sequential initiatives addressing the entire PM lifecycle in the company.

1. Finish the Product Manager track
    1. Start the specialization process with Julien and Kamiye
2. Revamp the recruitment process (including the Product Challenge)
    1. Break the process down into two variations: junior and (mid)-senior OR have only one process with adaptive assessment guidelines based on the level of experience
    2. Start involving Kamiye if he is interested in the people path specialization
3. Improve the Product Managers' training material to cater to juniors
4. Create a formal Product onboarding process
5. Revamp the Product 360 feedback forms

My plan is to complete those initiatives by the end of the year pretty much one after the other as most of the initiatives have some level of dependency on the previous one.

Please let me know if you have any comments.

Best,

Julien
