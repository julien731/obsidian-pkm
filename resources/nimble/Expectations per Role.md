# Expectations per Role

## Project Manager’s Expectations

- Ensure that the project meets its deadlines and that it goes according to plan.
    - You should know dates for everything. At least internally so that you know how to manage the project properly.
- Ensure that the team plans work in a realistic way and that they anticipate risks properly (technical risks, capacity risks, etc).
- When someone or something seems to be going off track, address it and fix it. Be creative with how you can fix problems.

## Product Manager’s Expectations

- Clear and consistent tracking of all changes made to your products. (E.g., use sprints, labels, milestones… whatever will bring clarity).
