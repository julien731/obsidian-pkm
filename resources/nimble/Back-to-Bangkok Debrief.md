# Back-to-Bangkok Debrief

- Smash Burger
    - The brands aims at profitability next year. It will be hard to push too much costs on them. Looking at a light contract. Kevin’s initial thoughts were 1 iOS and 1 Android.
    - Possibilities:
        - Option 1
            - Phase 1: takeover + maintenance (1 dev)
            - Phase 2: apps development (1/2 devs per app)
        - Option 2
            - Takeover + maintenance + apps development (1/2 devs per app, handle takeover —web— as well)
- Jollibee
    - Kevin feels that Jollibee is reluctant to use CX.
    - CX demo needs to be prepared for Glenn. Need to dig into Xander’s “localization concerns.”
    - They are not ready.
    - No more budget for the year. Kevin/JFC Global might have to fund it (which means less budget for SB).
- JFC Global
    - This is our entry point. It’s Kevin’s project, and it’s also his agenda. We need to make him happy as well.
- CBTL
    - CMO pushing back against e-commerce. She strongly feels that the brand sells itself. Loyalty is her sole focus.
    - Kevin will push against this strongly as he wants e-commerce.
