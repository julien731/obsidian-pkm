# Meeting with Jacques

- What chunk will he take from Carlos
- In terms of sales, does he really do sales (he says he does but it’s a bit blurry). Does he only bring the deal or he does the presales legwork?
- We have some salary ranges and hiring a lot of people unprofitable is just very easy (Appsynth had very little profit, why if they had stable long term customers), did they have any criteria for this? Engineering & product?
- Management style, how many subordinates?

# Pros

- Very friendly. Great attitude. He seems quite social and I could see him connecting with potential hires or business partners.
- He seems experienced. He’s got lots of stories. I think that we could learn from him and that we can contribute to building and improving our TA/BD.
- He sees the big picture. It is clear that he sees TA as a part of a larger picture and that all the parts are not only equally important but also dependent on each other.
- He has ideas. I’m not sure that he truly had opportunities before to build teams/processes in an official capacity but he has the right mindset.
- He has a business mindset. He connects talent with business, revenue, growth.
- He seems to have a “do what it takes” attitude.
- Some level of account management.

# Cons

- He seems to be mostly an IC. He did not have a team before.
- He doesn’t seem to have much structure. I think that there is an inherent part of mess in this line of work but there would be a need for a bit more structure.
- It seems important to him to be in control of information.
- He might be too compromising to get to his goals.
