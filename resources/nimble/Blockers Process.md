# Blockers Process

There can be elements out of the team's control when working on any project. Product Managers always strive to help their stakeholders unblock situations and make progress. However, it is essential to keep track of the out-of-our-control blockers that impact a project's timeline and budget. Tracking the blockers is even more critical for [closed-scope projects](https://nimblehq.co/compass/product/project-types/#project-type-requirements).

# What is Considered a Blocker

A blocker doesn't necessarily mean that the team cannot make any progress at all. Our team continuously seeks to make progress. We consider anything that impacts the project timeline and budget a blocker because it prevents our team from delivering the product within the agreed project parameters (requirements, budget, timeline).

## Missing Elements

We consider a blocker any missing element. For example (the following list is *not* exhaustive):

- Unanswered questions
- Missing information
- Missing credentials
- Lack of access to tools
- Unclear requirements
- Outdated or unusable design

## Scope Changes

Although acceptable through our [Request For Change process](https://nimblehq.co/compass/product/lifecycle/change-management/), a change in the project scope is also considered a blocker --especially for closed-scope projects-- because it will require research and planning time that was not accounted for when defining the project timeline and budget. Scope changes inevitably result in delays.

## Uncontrollable Delays

Generally speaking, a blocker can be anything that leads to a delay in the project timeline and, consequently, an increased cost caused by a timeline extension or the need for additional resources to complete the project within a set timeframe.

# How to Track Blockers

When a blocker arises, the Product Manager must immediately take action and follow these steps:

1. Log the blocker in our Notion blockers tracker.
2. Define an expected blocker resolution date.
3. Inform the primary stakeholder on the client's side about the blocker and its possible impact (typically delays and budget increase).

The Product Manager will then continuously update the status of the blocker in the Notion blockers tracker and report all updates and, finally, resolution.

# Resolving Blockers

As part of their daily activities, Product Managers are the ones leading to the resolution of any given blocker. Product Managers might not always have the capacity to resolve a blocker independently, but they must always promptly facilitate a blocker's resolution.

# Managing Commercial Expectations

Resolving blockers is always the primary objective. Yet, managing commercial expectations is an essential secondary objective.

As explained earlier, blockers usually lead to an increased timeline and budget. We must communicate the commercial impact to the client, and the client must acknowledge their responsibility for the delays and cost increase.

Managing commercial expectations is the responsibility of the Business Development team. For the Business Development team to manage expectations efficiently, we must establish an unambiguous communication flow between Product (identifying and resolving blockers) and Business (managing commercial expectations and creating the necessary commercial agreements).
