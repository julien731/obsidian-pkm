# 2025 EOY Speech

I’ve been looking for a way to describe this year in a word, and I landed on “stability.”

We have continued the groundwork on all projects and, while there were no “big moments” like we’ve had last year, we have reliably delivered tangible results to all clients.

- Record sales for Jollibee (and we’re continuing the work next year)
- We are close to achieving easyHotel’s ambitious revenue target for the year
- Both Jollibee NA and Smashburger called us back after our initial contract ended, because they still needed our expertise
- We are now powering over 220 CBTL stores in Malaysia (and we’re continuing the work next year)
- Okya is finding its first new clients after JFC

While it’s often more exciting to see the “big moments,” true progress happens in the long run. When working through phases of exciting times and steady forward momentum.

As always, all of your hard work and dedication has been a constant throughout the year.

For that, I am truly grateful, and proud to work with such a talented team. I want to thank you all for your contributions and for the positive impact that you all have on the team, and on the value that we're able to deliver.

Special thanks to our People Ops team, for taking care of us all year round, and for arranging this awesome trip for us all;

and to the TA team, for building this top-tier team.

I wish you all a fantastic end of the year and  hope you enjoy the weekend.
