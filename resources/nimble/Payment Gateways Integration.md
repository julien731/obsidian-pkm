# PayMaya

## Timeline

**Around 5 months.** It includes:

- Getting access to the environments.
- Getting clarity on poorly documented flows.
- Overarching security requirements (involving lots of operational work).
- Error reporting & debugging.
- Mobile apps integration & testing.

## Challenges

- Buggy products (facing lots of errors).
- Weak support (we have email threads over 50 messages long).
