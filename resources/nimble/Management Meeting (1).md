# Management Meeting

- Losing our product approach when working with enterprise clients.
- The product approach might actually not even be the best selling argument vs. the consulting approach (with Technical Architects.)
- The 1/Accenture is starting to panic and they are starting to point fingers at us (see email I  forwarded  this morning)
