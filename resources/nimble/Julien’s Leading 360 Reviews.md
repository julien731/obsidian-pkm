# Julien’s Leading 360 Reviews

# General

- Guide the person more on the review/self-assessment part.
- You needed to prepare the rating summaries.
- You feel quite hesitant. You lack conviction.
- You need to manage your time better.
- Give people an idea of the

# Aiden

- Please refrain from sharing the names of others when you bring up their feedback (e.g., Su noticed her bad English as well). You never know; better keep things anonymous.
- You need to do more work on understanding your reports’ issues and addressing them. E.g., the way she doesn’t seem to follow questions from stakeholders in meetings. Your feedback to her is basically, “stop doing that,” after she explained that she is nervous. You need to help her be less anxious. It seems to be the underlying problem. She does well when she prepares but not when new things come up. You need to help her with that.
- You ask about her backlog management flow but then cut it short because of time.
- You need to involve the person more when reviewing objectives’ progress. Don’t just say I think you’re good. Ask for their feedback, make them part of it, and make them responsible for their objectives.
- You need to be more critical when assessing people and their accomplishments (e.g., objectives for the right communication channel).
    - You need to know whether your reports completed an objective. You should not have hesitations.

# Maimai

- You were disconnected at the beginning. You left Maimai hanging when talking about her English level.
- Asking her what she thinks about the gap between her score and the team’s score it a bit of a weird question. Not sure what you expect to hear from her. On what basis do you expect her to explain the difference?
- You’re going too deep with the scores review. It’s not where you need to dive deep. If there are comments or essential elements you want to share, that’s fine, but you should not ask for a reason for everything unless there is something critical.
    - Overall it felt like a very hesitant process.
- You seemed highly hesitant.
- Pay more attention to people. There are times (e.g., when talking about Maimai not sharing and being proactive enough with the team) when Maimai seemed confused or at least not convinced. You need to make sure that your feedback is heard, understood, and accepted. If the person disagrees, you need to talk it out.
- You seemed super disconnected when talking about the objectives.
    - At that point, you were basically robot-reading everything.
