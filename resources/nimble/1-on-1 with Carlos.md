# 1-on-1 with Carlos

- What I'm doing
    - Tons of time spent on CBTL, JB, GT.
    - Realistically, the way the projects are being handled by the clients has dragged me down mentally.
- Where I think I'm not doing well
    - easyHotel: I should have taken over the app pitching once it was clear that this was the direction. We would likely be in a different place.
    - Not enough support on CX.
    - Not enough support with the business as a partner. Feel like I have not been pulling my weight.
- What I plan to change
    - More efforts on recruitment to free up more time and prepare for team growth (more leadership needs).
    - Would like to be more involved with other aspects of the company.
        - Lots of things I know you are dealing with (Olivier, office, etc).
        - Most likely lots of things I don’t even see.
