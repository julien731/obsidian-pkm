# Product Manager Handbook

[Product Manager's Handbook](https://www.notion.so/Product-Manager-s-Handbook-c38cd71c96ba4c4a9e7f0ff304a498b2?pvs=21) 

- Enforce processes
- Own the backlog and be its guardian
- Update clients
- Update CPO
- Monitor team performance
    - Raise performance concerns
- Responsible for the product development and delivery
- Must prioritize to maximize the value provided to clients
- Must QA and must QA continuously
- Line between Engineering Lead and TPM:
    - TPM doesn't decide technical choices but he understands them
    - By understanding them, he can break down the work in a way that can be iterative
    - TPM also decides what goes in which sprint on the technical work (in agreement with EL) because not all technical work is of the same importance
