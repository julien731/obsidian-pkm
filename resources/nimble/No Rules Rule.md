# No Rules Rule

1. Increase talent density
    - Continue being strict when hiring
    - Pay top-of-market
    - **Trust people (and their decision-making) or get rid of them**
2. Increase candor
    - Start by asking for more feedback from the team (e.g., during 1-on-1s)
    - Start *giving* more candid feedback *whenever it is necessary*
3. Open the books (no secrets)
4. Empower people (let them make their own decisions)
