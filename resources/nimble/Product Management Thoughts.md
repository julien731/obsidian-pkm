# Product Management Thoughts

# Introduction

This is not a retrospective. The Product Chapter Retrospective is and remains the place for all the retrospective content.

The Product Management Thoughts meeting is about getting all the Nimble Product Managers to discuss anything Product Management whether it's client-related, internal, or even general Product Management news, tools, processes, etc.

# When

The Product Management Thoughts meeting will occur every two weeks in alternance with the Product Chapter retrospective. The meeting is scheduled for one hour.

# Agenda

1. Warm-up: does anyone has product management challenges or thoughts to share?
2. Topic: we pick a topic that was previously submitted —either before the meeting or via the "Topics" box.
3. Wrap-up: we write down the meeting summary. If any action needs to be taken it is added to the initiatives list.
