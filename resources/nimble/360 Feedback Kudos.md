# 360 Feedback Kudos

Hey, guys.

As I'm reviewing the 360 feedback for the Product Chapter, I wanted to let you know about two Engineers who provided way above average feedback: Lydia and Mikey.

They both shared very detailed feedback (even though a bit verbose fro Mikey), more critical than others and also sharing their ideas for improvement. Lydia also added references (e.g., user stories, Slack conversations) which was very useful in the review process.

There was one small concern from Mikey's feedback though:

> Also he never actively helped clarify the goals via direct message from my observation, he only did it in group discussions.
> 

Group conversations are the way to go while DMs are to be avoided so I think that there might be a slight misunderstanding on this topic. Again, his feedback was way above average.

## Observations

- Most developers refer to PMs as Project Managers.
- For every PM there are always devs who like their user stories and other that don't find them good enough.
