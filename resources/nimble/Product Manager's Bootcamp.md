# Strategy

- Always ask for information int he right context. Create the context if necessary (e.g., to get insider information).
- Never trust anyone outside of the company however good the relationship with the client is. You never know the internal politics, conflicts of interest, and personal agendas.
- Become part of their team; let them forget that you're a vendor. It is when they will start sharing more insider information.
- Recognize information that can help move business cases forward.
