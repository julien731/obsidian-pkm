# Feedback for Carlos

You need to make less decisions to get back some of your time. To do that, you need to trust and empower your team more.

1. Provide guidelines for how the work needs to be done
2. Give clear context for each task or initiative that you need; this will enable the team to work independently
3. Trust the results (as long as they follow the guidelines) even if it’s not exactly how you’d do things

You need to give feedback the right way. The way you are doing it now is making people feel incompetent and stupid. The result is that nobody dares doing anything independently for fear of making you unhappy and getting your wrath. This vicious cycle then leads to you having to make all the decisions and the team delivering sub-par results because they don’t dare “trying” anything and, instead, they solely focus on attempting to do exactly what you might want them to do which, with very little context, leads to terrible results and the cycle repeats.
