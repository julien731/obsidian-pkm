# Involving PMs in Pre-Sales Meetings

- No clear objective and expected outcome to the meeting, making the PM with little context unsure of what needs to be done and what is the best way forward.
- No defined commercial goal on our side (at least none shared with the PM) leading the the PM not knowing what is best to propose.
