# Process Deviations

There is an exact process for Product Management activities. However, we know that there is always something that will deviate from the plan. Sometimes it's ok, and sometimes it can jeopardize the delivery of the project.

To avoid a catastrophic scenario, we need to be flexible enough with our process but not so much as to compromise the project.

# Flags

Each element of the Product Management process has a flag associated with it. If the project deviates from one part of the process for any reason, then the associated flag is triggered.

- Orange flag: an orange flag is a heads-up. It is not critical, even if repeated, but it is worth logging.
- Yellow flag: a yellow flag is a warning. If a yellow flag is triggered, the associated activity can continue, but it needs to be assessed and ideally corrected or not repeated.
- Red Flag: a red flag is critical and requires immediate attention. It needs to be escalated to the CPO immediately, and the team must take action.

## Flags Combinations

- Orange flags: can be combined indefinitely.
- Yellow flags: just like with football, two yellow flags results in a red flag.
- Red flags: the team must take action immediately with the first yellow flag.

# Responsibility Matrix

# Flags Log

Product Managers must log all flags immediately as they get triggered. We maintain the flags log in Notion, and there is a specific template for logging flagged events.

# Required Actions

## Orange Flag

An orange flag only requires logging in to the flagged events log.

## Yellow Flag

A yellow flag requires the Product Manager to inform the client of the process deviation and urge them to return to the process.

## Red Flag
