# Management Meeting Notes

- Commercial process: define steps and, for each step, define which department needs to be informed
    - e.g., lead (business) → discovery (product) → negotiations (engineering) → won
- Process for rotations
- Problems to solve:
    - Communication (most likely through process)
    - Tooling (to assemble teams and update billing)
