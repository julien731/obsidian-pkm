# Julien's One-on-One

## What Went Well

Very sadly, not much. I haven't had any actual wins in a long time now.

The one thing that went well is that I've had a really good team with The 1, especially with Olivier and Trung, Jason as well even though he's a bit too young, which I have been able to lean and rely on.

As a side note, Ankit is taking up the challenge of being team lead pretty well.

## What Could Be Better

A lot of things could be better. Unfortunately, the major part depends on me having more available time. Here are some of the things that I want to do but have no time for.

- Being up-to-date with all projects.
- Checking-in with all the clients to get a better sense of how things are going with their products and with the PMs.
- Having a regular PM catch-up session.
- Coaching the new PMs more.
- Working on process improvements (e.g. design versioning, design process & sprints, improving Compass.)
- Create basic product strategies applicable to all clients (e.g. Analytics, Facebook, SEO learnings from Overblock, etc.)

## Issues

- Way too much time spent on The 1.
- Acting pretty much as a Project Manager with The 1, not a Product Manager.
- Disconnected from other projects.
- Not enough time to lead the teams. Feeling more disconnected from the teams than before.

## Risks

- Losing our product approach when working with enterprise clients.
- The product approach might actually not even be the best selling argument vs. the consulting approach (with Technical Architects.)

## Feedback

- Drive the Product Chapter towards a quantitative goal
- Be more proactive with PMs recruitment

## Objectives

- Time management. Give more to the team.
- Give measurable goals to all members of the product team.
