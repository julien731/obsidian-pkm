# General Feedback

- Think of who the readers will be. They don’t have the same level of knowledge that you have.
- **Take a step back, look at the bigger picture.**
    - Create a story that is linear, logical, and easy to follow.
- Always provide context.
- Give the readers one and only one starting point.
- Try to keep the same base structure between all documents.
- **Be lengthy when bringing context; be direct to the point when sharing details.**

# What went well

- Individually, the documents have structure and are pretty easy to read
- Good use of illustrations/screenshots to improve the clarity
- Good linking between pages

# What could be better

## General

There are lots of documents but they are not easily “findable” because there is no centralized place **with context** explaining everything that’s available.

There is a [summary page](https://arv.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/VSMA/pages/377126913/ARV+Project+Summary) but it only shows a very limited set of documents. This should have been the perfect place to have a general table of contents showing everything that’s available while giving context.

## **PDPA Questionnaire**

- No introduction or context
- Too much information, especially if it is not directly relevant, brings confusion

- No clear mapping of some information

- Overall, strictly stick to the point

## **Flutter App - Documentation**

- The section “Technical Knowledge Sharing” feels out of place

## **Flutter Deep Link**

- Documentation should be focused on documenting, not on the decisions (unless you actively document a decision making process).
If you want to document the decision (which can be helpful) then separate it from the feature documentation.

## Feature: eKYC NFC / Assisted

- Where is the actual feature documentation?
- I don’t understand the three different tables
