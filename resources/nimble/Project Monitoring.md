# Project Monitoring

# Purpose

Projects monitoring serves multiple purposes. The main and most obvious one is to make sure that the project moves forward nicely and is on time (for fixed-timeline projects).

It also helps identify trends both in the development team and in the product management team.

The questions that the projects monitoring needs to answer are the following:

- Performance
    - Is the project on time?
    - Is the team velocity within standard range?
    - Is the cycle time within standard range?
- Quality
    - Is the backlog well groomed?
    - Is QA done on time? (check the lead time on Clubhouse)
    - Are sprints followed closely enough?
    - Are user stories clear enough?
- Planning
    - Is the backlog up to date?
    - Are there unestimated stories?
- Check all projects
- Check the app(s)

# Procedures

The following steps should be repeated for each project.

## Performance

- [ ]  Check (iteration/milestone/project) burndown chart
- [ ]  Check the average velocity
- [ ]  Check the velocity trend
- [ ]  Check the cycle time

## Quality

- [ ]  Check a set of 10 random user stories
- [ ]  Find untagged user stories (iteration, epic, version)
- [ ]  Count "Ready for QA" stories
- [ ]  Check iteration burndown for added stories/points

## Planning

- [ ]  Look for empty epics
- [ ]  Look for missing epics
- [ ]  List unestimated stories
