- Need CX to send notifications. Braze and Segment are only coming in the picture Q1 2025.
    - Need to find out what kinds of segments Jollibee needs to support.
    - Potential integration with Wavecell/8x8 for routing SMS in PH.
        - SMS (e.g., account registration, order confirmed, etc) need to be registered with the PH telco. Otherwise the SMS will most likely be blocked.
