# Leadership Offsite - Product Team

# Introduce your team and how you manage it in a few words.

Slides.

# What is the greatest opportunity that you see for the company?

## Julien L.

We can become the consultancy known for solving the problems others can't. This is a unique position which will define us as the industry experts.

“Ex-Google” and the likes don't really mean much anymore. “Ex-Nimble” will.

## Vu

- We have a strong team, a great mindset, and a consistent culture code, working with a giant client and having their truth. That’s a great opportunity to create more impact rather than just feature delivery and expand our business.

## Julien V.

Offering more consulting than software development. If our potential clients start to see us as a consulting firm rather than a software house, I believe the client relationships will last longer and sell more services.

Additionally, the nature of the work may become more interesting as we will get a chance to do more than perfectly execute projects, increasing employee happiness.

# What we should be doing that we are not currently doing as a company?

## Julien L.

We are doing great at building and solving problems but we aren't good yet at nurturing our clients. 

## Julien V.

- Understanding the business of our clients more so we know how to maximize our impact. A shift must happen so that everyone understand clearly what business value we’re delivering, not what code we’re producing.
- Getting better at understanding who the target audience is, getting a chance to do qualitative user research, talk to real users and get real feedback. We base our assumptions on what the client provides, not real access to data.
- Defining real MVP strategies, so we can prove the value of our work faster.

# What we should be doing that we are not currently doing within my team?

## Julien L.

Share knowledge and leverage the strengths of each contributor.

## Vu

- Consultancy mentality and skill sets: Our PMs have ideas, but most don't communicate them well with consultants.
- People have many ideas about our products and projects; however, we do not have a clear process for quickly turning those ideas into action plans and bringing them to life.

## Julien V.

- Clearly communicating the risks we identify, because they’re real and they need to be tackled.
- Finding ways to share valuable insights, more knowledge sharing. Real wins, real challenges. We see too little of what our peers are busy solving, of what our colleagues are good.
- Getting ourselves in a position where we can do split testing to validate our ideas against real users. Work hand in hand with clients to continuously track and verify the metrics we are trying to move.
- Encourage knowledge sharing via fun experiments: having the time to play around with exciting tools, try things out, and build things for the sake of learning.

# What actions we will take to increase our speed as a company?

## Julien L.

Increase cross-team collaboration and distribute product ownership.

## Vu

- Distributed decision-making process: Who decides what?
- Have a clear competencies mapping to define PM career framework clearly. Which helps define the scope of work and career path and accelerate the hiring process.
- We should have more cross-project alignment and idea exchange.

## Julien V.

- Rebranding or adjustment to our company website, for something that reflects more of a consulting approach.
- Find ways to recruit the right people faster to support the growth.
- Increased AI usage to automate or accelerate some tasks

# What is the biggest risk that you see for the company?

## Julien L.

The speed at which we can hire new team members.

Our business is heavily based on our capacity to ramp up fast. We need to create a strong expertise at managing capacity.

## Vu

- Largest projects come from 1 big client.
- PM hiring is still slow and potentially a roadblock when more projects come in the future.

## Julien V.

- Low employee retention. Getting stuck doing the same thing repeatedly without a clear perspective of what your job could look like in 3-5 years. Leaders need to inspire.

# Question

- Engineering: How might Engineering team maintain innovation, stay updated with the latest technologies so that new initiatives are generated and acted upon regularly, while also focus on client project/business impact?
- Product:
    - How might we communicate our value better so that clients think of us as a strategic partner rather than a delivery partner?
    - How might we increase our ownership so that we can influence the decision makers?
    - How might we make successes & achievements more visible so that clients trust us more?
- Operations: How might we improve the Operations Team’s mindset so that the Operations Team can proactively anticipate / identify the company needs and have timely adjustment toward the company’s direction? In this way, Operations Team can have more thorough budget planning and better cash flow control.
- TA: How might we conduct regular recruitment audits so that we can identify and address inefficiencies in our hiring practices?

# Action Points from the Questions

- Share (Powerpoint) presentations when reviewing with the client
- Start broadcasting client KPIs in our offices publicly. Complete the KPIs [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IlrJXxpquj26XMe4AlXAbYy36-lJItqcuDJfEU-YO2g/edit?usp=sharing).
- Turn the dress code up one notch to project more professionalism and inspire more trust with our clients and partners
- Improve the team's English communication (verbal, pronunciation, grammar).
    - For grammar, use Grammarly over AI as it teaches you how to improve rather that redoing the work for you.
- Learn how to create impactful documents: content and form.
- Reinstate a regular thought leadership meeting and create a wider leadership alignment catch up.
- All hands
    - Reinstate all hands
    - It could be the outcome of the leadership catch-up
    - Maybe quarterly?
    - Mix the all hands with a happy hour even and invite clients and partners
- Marketing
    - Redefine the brand (in progress)
    - Clarify our identity and ensure that all leaders know how to present the company in a unified way
- TA
    - Align on the non-negotiable to avoid situation where we move candidates forward just in case there is a good surprise
    - We need to train hiring managers and interviewers to ensure we have alignment and consistency on the traits, mindset, and soft skills we need from new team members
