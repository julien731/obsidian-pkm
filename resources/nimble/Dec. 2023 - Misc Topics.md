# Dec. 2023 - Misc Topics

<aside>
💡 Some of the topics below are urgent but none require immediate action.

- JFC contracts addendums for 2024
    
    I've added 2 addendums to the JFC SOWs:
    
    - [JFC003](https://docs.google.com/document/d/186x8q1mB_5TpDmoDjrNITdeUKdVM6p-T2jESfZR1cGs/edit?usp=sharing) (GT mobile)
    - [JFC005](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cyy-_bUQ7h0EpPdDYzWyqFNM4ExHAiYPW9KlBE9mPaE/edit?usp=sharing) (GT web)
- Tam & CX ✅
    
    Tam interested but she has some concerns. I think the next steps would be to organize a chat with her.The concerns that she shared are:
    
    - No experience in the F&B industry. "this means even if I try my best, it's very likely there will be mistakes."
    - "I'm not as technical as other PMs here, and to be honest, I don't think I will want to get to that level of being able to check code I'm interested in answering what and why, rather than how (I believe if we gonna build a product, we need engineers that we can trust they know **how** to do it)"
    
    Next step: organize a chat with her.
    
- Trung ✅
    
    I’ve had a chat with Trung today. He is getting stressed about the situation with Olivier. More specifically, the lack of communication and action (addressing the whole team, not him personally). He is starting to struggle managing communication on topics such as the 1-on-1s and needs some decisions made (e.g., [recruitment process](https://nimble-co.slack.com/archives/G6BSWFJV6/p1702027538316289)).
    
    The trigger here is that Olivier basically told him that he is now done with Nimble and will start disconnecting completely.
    
    Trung is not comfortable making big plans (e.g., Engineering team restructuring) because it’s not in his scope. Basically, the message I heard is that he wants something official to happen which will legitimize him *and* give him decision-making power.
    
    There is more we talked about. Let me know if you want to catch up on this.
    
    Based on this conversation, I think we need to do the following two things urgently:
    
    - Officially promote Trung as VP.
    - Setup a recurring leadership meeting to make, discuss, and align on post-Olivier plans.
- Replacing the people leaving
    
    We need to staff for the following people who are leaving soon. Both are CBTL.
    
    - Elen (end of Jan.)
    - Aiden (end of Feb.)
