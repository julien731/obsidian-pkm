# DeeMoney Project Failure RCA

## Overview

The DeeMoney project has spiraled our of control. We have entered a controversy where the client wants the original scope delivered within the original timeline despite the project having gone through many changes and new features being added. The client does not want to take responsibility for the changes.

## What Happened

The DeeMoney project started off as a lead with very few details, a short bidding timeline, and an aggressive pricing requirement.

In order to get a chance to receive the project, we have estimated the project —based on the designs provided— as tight as possible. We got awarded the project on a closed-scope basis: fixed budget (with fixed man-days) and a fixed timeline (end of 2020).

As we started the development, the level of complexity increased steadily and new features, screens, and flows became mandatory to bring the project to completion.

The necessary changes and additions were made to enable the project to move forward. However, this was incompatible with the closed-scope nature of the project. By making changes, the effort required naturally grew bigger driving to a longer implementation timeline.

Instead, and again, given the closed-scope nature of the project, I should have immediately put the project on hold, clarifying the needs for changes, and prompting a contract renegotiation.

## **What Went Well**

Nothing stands out.

## **What Didn't Go So Well**

- The initial project scope was not completed within the committed timeline
- Lack of a sufficient buffer in the project estimation despite known risks (mainly the missing API documentation)
    - Overly optimistic assumption about the ease of use of the unknown API
- Changes and additional features added, resulting in an increased implementation effort, have been done without explicit acknowledgment from the client that the original timeline & features would be impacted
- Failure to identify the mismatch between the expected contractual terms and the expected working methodology early
- No decisive action taken when warning signs were raised

## Contributing Factors

### Open-Scope Sale Approach

During the sales process and in the pitching meeting, I emphasized with the client that our approach is to do whatever it takes to get the work done. This was not entirely compatible with the type of project (closed-scope) which, at the time of pitching, was already known.

Instead, I should have gone in the opposite direction or at least more nuanced: warning the client that, with their desired contract type, there is the possibility that change requests will be raised and that it would require a project update including an RFC involving additional costs.

### Improper PM Onboarding

Improper onboarding of Palm leaving her to write the user stories for the project without proper training. This led to spending too much time writing the user stories for the original scope and blurred the line between original scope, changes, and new features or implementation details.

### Unwarranted Client Trust

Given the personal connections with one of the stakeholders, I have altered my judgment and put a level of trust in what the client shared about their tech —without proof— which I should not have.

### Lack of Project Visibility

As Olivier mentioned in the management meeting, we lack visibility at the project level. What I mean by that is that there is no clear way to view the progress at the same level as what is outlined in the Scope of Work signed by the client.

### Communication

Communicating information to the client too late.

## Resolution

In progress.

## Impact

- A potential loss in revenue (unfortunately likely)
- Damage to our company reputation
- Severing existing personal relationships with one of the stakeholders
- Added pressure on Palm which could have been avoided

## Action Items

### Pitch According to Project Type

- I will prepare an explanation for each project type with their pros and cons targeted to potential clients
- I will prepare a template provision for the SOW to specify the possibility of RFC in the context of closed-scope projects and outline the workflow in case it happens

### Create a Training Path for PMs

Similarly to what is done for developers, I will create a training path for Product Managers and following this training path before working on a client project will be a requirement.

The training path shouldn't be overly time-consuming.

### Define Internal Guidelines per Project Type

I will define the two project types (open and closed scope) and establish practical guidelines for Product Managers to follow for each type.

One part of this exercise will be to create a workflow for handling:

- Estimations mismatch (when a feature appears much bigger than what it was originally estimated to be),
- Change requests,
- Technical blockers (with an emphasis on undisclosed technical challenges from the client).

Everything will be logged. Any of these events will trigger an immediate escalation to the client and templates will be used to standardize the entire process and simplify the decision-making process.

### Create a Project Management-Focused Process

I will define a methodology to have access to a progress report at the same level as what is communicated and signed by the client in the SOW. This Project Management approach will enable higher-level tracking and identifying bottlenecks at the macro level.

### Communicate More and Better

Communication has been an issue at multiple occasions. One tool to help fixing this issue will be to setup a routine for checking-in and updating clients on a regular basis, forcing myself to be more active and vocal about successes, risks, and issues.

With all of the above action items in place, the improved communication should lead to more valuable information communicated to the client and an early warning and escalation of issues.
