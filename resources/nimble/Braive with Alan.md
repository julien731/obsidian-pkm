# Braive with Alan

- **Lack of documentation (overall.)** Alan is trying to get a hang on the various features and logic but it's a difficult process because almost nothing is documented.
    - Alan has a list of questions and things that need to be documented.
- **We should be moving to Notion.** Alan will create a workspace. Confluence is not a great tool and Alan seems to be a Notion fan as well so we will be moving existing documentation and creating all new material on the Notion workspace that Alan will create.
- **Design is a bottleneck.** Hiring a new designer should help with that a lot by giving more available design time to Braive.
    - Alan has no problem bulking things together to only trigger work worth at least a few days to a week.
- **Not enough involvment from product design.** Alan would like to have the possibility to work closer to product design to find improvement opportunities and new ideas.
    - This needs to be defined as part of the 2020 design roadmap.
- **Work on finding KPIs.** Julien thinks that a way to start working more closely at a strategic level is to identify KPIs and setup Analytics tracking to start making data-driven decisions.
