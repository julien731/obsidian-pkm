# Self-Assessment

# 2021-02

## What Went Well

## What Didn't Go So Well

- Need better follow-up on reports' objectives.

# 2021-01

## What Went Well

- Lots of product processes and guidelines documented
- More structure with the product initiatives

## What Didn't Go So Well

- Did not want to let go of some execution-level tasks leading to 3 main issues:
    - Held some initiatives back while they could have been moved forward with delegation
    - Kept me on the execution level more than necessary leading to Carlos having to fill-in for the activities and responsibilities that I should have fulfilled
    - Kept me in between a micro and a macro-level view of projects (especially DeeMoney) which prevented me from seeing the inevitable problem that Carlos warned me about (which I could have seen at both the micro and macro level if properly focused on one)
- Unprepared for the rapid growth of the Product team and the resulting effort to onboard and guide the new joiners
- Lack of Product process documentation leading to additional efforts and time required to onboard the new joiners
    - Led to discrepancies in the Product Management process across PMs/projects
- Did not take "Thinking Time" limiting the improvements and larger-scale changes that I could have driven
