# Julien’s Interviews

- 2023-08-16 - Jiravut Thesngamthaun
    - Don’t call the challenge “homework.” It has a negative connotation.
    - Your questions are still too closed. E.g., question 2. Your follow up is asking “what else do you need to ask” while it should be more open (e.g., “are there any other things you’d need to know?”).
        - “What else can you use” fro question 5. It’s a closed question. Better phrasing example: are there any other things that you might be looking at?
    - Move through the interview faster when you know it’s a fail.
        - e.g., question 6. His answer was very underwhelming. You can just move on in such a scenario (where there is clearly very little to no hope that he will produce a better answer).
        - e.g., question 7. Lots of time spent there when the interview is already a fail. His answer to question 7 reinforces that him communication skills and mental clarity are insufficient.
        - e.g., question 10. His answer was a clear fail. Your follow kinda gives him the answer. The question is meant to understand how they think and what they consider smart. His answer clearly showed that he did not understand the purpose of the question and that he is not opinionated enough.
        - e.g., candidate’s question about our process. He clearly did not research us. It’s all documented on Compass. Move fast on this. No need to spend time explaining what he could have just read on Compass.
            - Same for his question about the scale of the projects we have. He asked “is it very small projects.” Come on. This is very obvious if you take a quick look at our resources.
    - Robotic reading of the questions, still. E.g., question 9.
    - Keep it open when asking candidates if they have questions. It’s not “their turn to ask questions.” They just can if they want to.
    - Candidate’s question about why we need Thai PMs. Better explain that it helps build relationships with our Thai clients rather than turning it into a way that says we have a problem with Thai clients.

- 2023-08-09 - Parinya Kamnoed
    - Question 6: your follow-up is too specific. Be more open-ended.
    - Question 8: don’t assume. Just ask for an example.

    - You need to figure out faster if the candidate is not a good fit and save your time by moving through the interview faster and maybe even cutting it short if/when it makes sense.
        - Overall you need to control the tempo of the interview better.
    - The way you ask question 5 is misleading. “Should be removed or not” is not the question. It’s just “how would you know if a feature should be removed.” “Or not” implies that someone might be looking at each feature specifically with the objective of discarding them.
    - You tend to ask follow-up questions that are too closed. E.g., question 7: “what can you do for X”
    - You need to think higher level. Candidate asked about how you manage conflict between different agendas (client’s timeline, estimations, devs’ speed). Your answer was correct but too focused on execution (i.e., explain how you do estimations). A better and high-level answer in this context is to talk about communication.

- 2023-08-02 - Jacek Wozniak
    - Your delivery is still not very smooth. You need to be more prepared when asking the questions. You need to appropriate the questions (question 6 is a good example).
        - Bad delivery examples: questions 9, 10.

- 2023-05-31 - Mo (Tanaporn Rithinondh)
    - If a candidate is an obvious fail, don’t hesitate to speed up the questions and even skip some.
    - Very abrupt ending.
- 2023-02-15 - Hien Pham

    - q2: you’re pushing a bit too much in the sense that he answered everything that’s on him mind already.
    - q3: you’re giving parts of the answer. The candidate doesn’t seem to know.
    - q6: an example of a question where your delivery is not very smooth. Not too bad, and the clarification that followed was good. q10 as well.
    - When asking candidates if they have questions, you kind of corner them with statements such as “your turn” or “you can ask questions.” Just ask them if they have questions and go from there.
    - When answering candidates’ questions, think about the value that you can provide (i.e., how can you use the opportunity to show them why working at Nimble is good).
    When the candidate asked you about a difficult situation, you should insist more on what you’ve done to solve the problem. You mentioned it briefly but most of your answer is about the bad situation itself.
- 2023-02-08 - Tam Nguyen
    - Better intro than the last interviews.
        - Time for questions at the end is part of the schedule. It’s not “if we have time.”
    - Clear transitions between questions.
    - Smoother questions.
    - Too much of the answer in your follow-up question for q3 (how would you break down the feature).
    - Question 5: your follow up is a bit abrupt (”which means?”) and felt a bit too academic (in the sense that you’re asking for “the right answer” from the candidate). Better follow up: “could you clarify what you mean by that?”
    - You had a more positive/inviting attitude than on the previous interviews.
    - “Feel free to ask any question” → “Do you have any questions?”
        - If the candidate doesn’t have any question then you end up in a weird situation where nobody has anything to say anymore.
- 2023-01-19 - Sidhartha sah
    - A better (nicer) way to tell people they haven’t answered your question is to tell them “what I’m more interested in is…” or “on the specific topic of… what do you think”
    - Good answer to his follow up question about user stories. “Whatever you think is needed to get the product that you want.” It’s clear and does not give any actual answer.
    - What are you looking for when asking for several examples of mistakes? Not that this is right or wrong, I’m just wondering what you’re looking for.
    - Follow up on the question about sprint planning → I would recommend that you don’t spend more time because it’s very clear he doesn’t know at all.
- 2023-01-18 - Viet Cao Hoai
    - Intro was good. You mentioned almost all the important things. Don’t forget to tell candidates that they will have some time for questions at the end (so that they don’t start asking too early or think that they won’t have time at all).
    - You continue reading questions word-for-word. It feels like you are not prepared.
        - You’ve been reading some of the questions like a robot lol you are way too robotic when asking (reading) questions.
    - “How would you know if a feature should be removed” → you kinda gave him the answer.
        - “for example if a feature is not used anymore…”
    - Your transition from one question to the next is still not very smooth.
- 2022-11-23 - Tai Ngo Phat (Ralph)
    - Pas pro la follow up question ou tu finis par dire “let’s just move on”
    - q4 -> candidate asked whether it’s closed-scope or T&M. It’s a good question, ask him about each scenario
    - q5 -> “How do you know if a feature should be removed or not? -> give more context (existing product, it’s in production and has users)
    - You often struggle with this question
    - q6 -> key elements of a user story
    - Don’t ask the question like there is one correct answer (what are the elements a good user story must have). Keep it more open (e.g., what do you think are key elements… or in your experience, what key elements should always be in a user story…)
    - You tend to rephrase your questions too quickly if the candidate does not answer immediately. Wait for them first.
- 2022-11-10 - Luca Bontempi
    - Bonne intro. Smooth flow.
    - Be careful not to make it sound like there is 1 correct answer to the question (e.g., user stories)
    - Ask clarifying questions but don’t make assumptions (e.g., AC and “what” of a user story, isn’t it the same thing?)
    - Generally speaking, try to ease into the question. You tend to ask too much upfront. E.g., have you made mistakes? what were they? what did you do about it?
    - “We have a few minutes left, feel free to ask questions.” -> That’s a bit abrupt . Does he have any questions?
    - Stop with “I don’t know” when answering candidates’ questions  You know

    - The intro was kinda half-assed. You didn’t clearly explain how the interview is going to be conducted nor mentioned that there will be time for questions at the end.
    - Not very clear when asking questions, repeating yourself a few times (e.g., questions 2 and 3).
        - Your flow was not as smooth as in the last few interviews. It sometimes felt like you’re first reading the question for yourself and then you kind of repeat it for the candidate.
    - The last question *really is* about “smart” (you rephrased it) and that’s because understanding what the candidate considers “smart” gives valuable insight.

    - Forgot again to tell the candidate about question time at the end of the interview
    - Good “what do you mean by that” follow ups. It asks for more without directing the candidate in a specific direction.
    - Some questions (e.g., q4, q6, q8) are not worth pushing too much if you don’t get the core answer quickly. You manage the follow ups as you want but this is my personal recommendation.
- 2022-06-23 - Pham Thanh Huyen
    
    [https://airtable.com/appHG70yLZoV5SDJF/tblFW4CFhvqQ87G3s/viwQNFAtAqrJQmmMU/reck6gzubxKdJLQGW?blocks=hide](https://airtable.com/appHG70yLZoV5SDJF/tblFW4CFhvqQ87G3s/viwQNFAtAqrJQmmMU/reck6gzubxKdJLQGW?blocks=hide)
    
    - Forgot to intro the second part of the interview where the candidate can ask their questions
    - Good follow up question q3 (what would you discuss with the tech team)
    - Question 5 is not super well written, give more context (i.e., existing product with actual users)
    - Question 6 follow up: “do you attach user stories to something?” → Broader question: How do you organize your user stories?
    - Good follow up q7: how did you handle the problem with the client (missing AC)
    - When candidates ask about challenges, try to think about the bigger picture instead of thinking about project-related challenges. Two reasons:
        - It gives a better idea of where we are as a company to the candidate
        - It could potentially give a bad feeling if you talk about something negative because of an annoying client

    ## Main Takeaways
    
    - You need to get more familiar with the questions
    - You need to manage the time better
    
    ## Notes
    
    - Your personal introduction is too deep. No need to explain your background, better save time.
    - Don’t spend too long on a question, especially if it’s not actually a good answer (e.g., question 1)
    - Question 3 was not very clear. The main difference is not so much new client vs. existing client (which is what you emphasized) but project idea vs. new feature for an existing product.
    - Try not to rephrase your follow up questions unless the candidate asks or doesn’t understand it correctly.
    - Don’t share judgement (”quite a comprehensive answer” for question 2) or make assumptions (”I’m sure you’ve experienced it” question 4); remain factual.
    - Question 4: follow up “so you will have a conversation with the client” → “yes” → so? how do you handle it?
    - Question 6: probably too detailed in the follow up questions (e.g., types of user stories, backend stories)
    
    ## Timeline
    
    - Question 3: 11:05
    - Question 5: 11:10
    - Question 7: 11:20

    ## Notes
    
    - Minor comment: Intro: there *might* be a product challenge depending on the outcome of the interview.
    - Oriented follow up questions
        - Question 2: “besides understanding the business problem, do you need something else” tells the candidate that their answer is incomplete. Another way to ask could be “how do you make sure that you understand the business problem?”
        - Question 4: “are there cases where you push back.” Another way to ask could be: “what could the the answers you might give the client” (she had just mentioned that what she will do depends on the “answer” to the impact of the changes as discussed with the team)

    ## Notes
    
    - You forgot to introduce the second part of the interview (i.e., time left for questions at the end).
    - Good follow up question for question 1 (why was the client difficult?)
    - You kind of gave him the answer to question 3 😄 (do you do assessment of the dependencies, technical assessment)
    - Good follow up to question 6. It kind of changed the entire context.
    - When trying to confirm your understanding of a candidate’s answer, try to not state what you think you understood so as to not orient them (e.g., question 7 “so your mistake was XXX”, instead, just “so what exactly was YOUR mistake in this case?”
    - Be careful with how you answer candidates’ questions. This is how we sell the company (especially to someone who we’d want to hire). It’s fine to take a minute to think about how to answer but don’t mention things like “out of inspiration.”

    - Question 3: was it a communication problem or does he just not dig at all and gets to work right away? Question to attempt to answer:
        
        > “Do you you create product documentations? Do you have a methodology for that?”
        >
