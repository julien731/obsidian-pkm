# Handover Process

- No actual template BUT
- It’s mostly about attitude
- Communicate early and often
- Offer help
- Follow up
- USE EMAILS

It’s mostly about providing as much as possible to client before things end and make sure that the client was given the opportunity to provide feedback.

Never ask for confirmation. Instead, tell clients that they can respond if they have comments of feedback
