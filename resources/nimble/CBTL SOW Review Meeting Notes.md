# CBTL SOW Review Meeting Notes

- Proposal
    - Costing
        - Cost to setup the core system (i.e., what we have discussed during the hackathon)
        - What would be the minimum cost to roll out to a new country (i.e., integration costs such as POS)
            - In other words, what’s the minimum cost to “copy and paste” the system to a new country and make it work.
        - What will be the rate for change requests (different countries will inevitably have some specific requirements)
    - Corporate website
        - They want to revamp the corporate website.
        - Currently, each country has its own website.
        - In the future, they need 1 international website where each country can manage their own content.
            - Not much details yet about what it would be. They are doing requirements gathering next week.
- Multiple markets rollout
    - How can we plan for that? We need to start working on it soon.
    - If CBTL wants to roll out to 10 new markets next year, do we have the capacity to support them?
    - Probably rolling out to 20/30 markets by 2025.
- Contracts
    - Carlos sent the MSA to Kevin. Kevin sent the JFC MSA to Carlos. This will take a while.
    - Can we have the MSA with CBTL to start? It will be faster.
        - Sent the MSA to Leroy so that he can share with legal.
