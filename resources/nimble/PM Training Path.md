# PM Training Path

# Introduction

Being a Technical Product Manager involves the three traditional pillars: business, UX, and tech.

The tech part, however, encompasses much more than what's typically asked of non-technical Product Managers.

To get Product Managers up to speed, we devised this training path to give you the right foundations as a Product Manager and especially working for Nimble. It also aims at kickstarting your career growth.
