    Running restaurants is hard. Margins are low, competition is high, high staff turnover, employees aren’t always reliable… and that’s only the *basics* of running restaurants. Innovating is

    Imagine a world where businesses can truly personalize their customer interactions and provide seamless experiences that drive loyalty and growth. A world where every touchpoint, from mobile apps to digital menu boards and Point-of-sale (POS), is connected to a core data platform that enables businesses to learn about their customers and craft the next best offers. This is the world that CX (the product codename), the next-generation B2B application, is set to create.
    
    With CX, businesses can take control of their online-to-offline destiny and manage their operations with ease. The product offers four powerful modules.
    
    - **CDP (Customer Data Platform).** Finally enables businesses to learn about their customers and personalize the brand experience.
    - **E-commerce** brings online and offline sales under one roof, with all the benefits that entails. CX integrates with existing hardware (point of sale, display systems, etc.).
    - **Loyalty.** Increases brand awareness, purchasing habits, and frequency. Coupled with CDP, businesses can precisely target customers and generate the next best offers through the next best channel.
    - **CMS (Content Management System).** Supports the business’ various platforms (e.g., website, mobile apps, landing pages).
    
    CX is designed to remove fragmentation and enable true data sharing and personalization. By allowing any third party to send digital signals to the platform, CX can create **virtually unlimited personalization and automation scenarios.** The product is event-driven, and by integrating with the hardware in use, such as POS and KDS systems, businesses can provide seamless experiences that drive loyalty and growth.
    
    Imagine you pull out your phone and order from your favorite cafe’s mobile app. You head over to the cafe to pick up your order. As you walk in, a notification tells you your order is ready and reminds you of the order number.
    
    You walk up to the counter, tell the staff your order number, and they instantly greet you:
    
    “Welcome back, John! Your Americano is ready. Did you know you can get your favorite item, an iced latte, for free with your next purchase? Just select the offer in the app with your next order!”
    
    Behind the scenes, after you placed your order, the staff immediately received it on their POS. After they accepted your order, it was automatically sent to the KDS (Kitchen Display System) so the crew could prepare it in time.
    
    As you walk out of the store, you receive another notification telling you that you’ve received additional loyalty points and that your favorite item will be free with your next order.
    
    This entire scenario, and many more, can be fully powered by CX by integrating with the hardware in use (POS, KDS, display systems).
    
    **CX is transforming the way businesses operate and interact with their customers.**
