# 2023 EOY Party Speech

Last year, I talked about the importance of keeping eachother accountable and doing our best work.

While this holds true now and forever, there are some important ingredients to the recipe.

As Carlos mentioned, 2023 has been a tough year.

Throughout the year **we’ve had challenges and great successes**. What I want to share with you tonight are some of the **ingredients that were common to all our successes.**

We talked about ownership earlier. This truly is a core part of who we are. **It is also easy to interpret it different ways.**

The first step to taking ownership is to **understand, in no uncertain terms, our destination.** What does that mean practically speaking?

- What are we here to solve?
- What are the problems our clients are facing which are bad enough that they need help?
- What are the business improvements that our clients want to make?

If anyone, right now, is working on a project without knowing the answers to those questions, then you’re lacking the foundational ingredients to success. Go find the answers!

It is everyone’s responsibility to get those ingredients together. Those who know (PM), you must share with your entire team.

If anyone happens to be unsure or unclear about the destination for their project, raise your hand (figuratively, not right now!) and ask.

**In short, everyone on the team must know without a doubt were they need to go.**

Have you ever seen those rowing boat races in Thailand. They have very long boats with a dozen people on it rowing all together.

Imagine if they were trying to race without all knowing their direction. They wouldn’t go very far. It would be chaos.

We are also a team on a boat. Ours is figurative, but the method is the same. We must all understand where we’re going so that we can all row in sync.

There is another thing that happens when everyone knows the destination. **Everyone can help find the best route.** That’s another thing that “ownership” means. Everyone can, and should, help figure out the best route to get to where we need to go.

User stories, story points, sprint planning… all of those things are secondary. They are just tools. Signals. They matter, but they are not the destination.0

Once everyone knows the destination, anyone can help find the most efficient route. More than that, anyone can see what the next point should be.

Now, analogies are all good and fun, but what does this mean really?

It means that if you understand what aspect of our clients’ business we are aiming to improve and why, you will be able to see the most efficient way to achieve the goals. You will also be able to speak up if you think that the current plans are not the best ones. And you will be able to make new plans when necessary.

We must all have that clarity. Product Managers, Designers, Developers. And we must all work very closely together to make sure that everyone has that clarity.

I have a great deal of confidence in our team. I know, for a fact, that we can deliver exceptional results. We have done it. To continue doing it, we just need to row in the same direction.
