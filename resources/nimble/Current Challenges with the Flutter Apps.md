# Current Challenges with the Flutter Apps

- More regressions than normal.
- Requires a lot of effort (manual builds) to get the build for a specific client.
    - QA is more difficult because of that, leading to lots of rushed, last-minute fixes.
- I sense some unease for merging PRs, especially for new apps (e.g., white label app).
- I am already not comfortable with releasing updates to production (we failed 2 CBTL OM updates in a row).
