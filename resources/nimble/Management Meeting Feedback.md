# Management Meeting Feedback

- Joseph shared that he was both very happy and impressed to see that we are letting Lotus go
    - He was very pleased to see that PMs are being listened
- Lead Product Manager role is officially live with Julien being the first lead
    - Still work required to create documentation (e.g., handbook) to make everything clear and share with everyone in the company
    

PMs ask for feedback at Thoughtworks. Account management. How?
