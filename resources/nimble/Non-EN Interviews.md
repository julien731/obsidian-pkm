# Non-EN Interviews

1. Ask the candidate if they are ok doing the interview in EN
2. Assess their current level (should we use some sort of online EN test?)
3. Explain that improving EN will be a requirement
4. Ask if they are willing to do that

- Need preliminary assessment. Is it worth having an EN hiring manager in the interview or only someone who speaks the language?
