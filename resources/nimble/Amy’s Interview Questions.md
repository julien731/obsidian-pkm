# Amy’s Interview Questions

- Why such a high price for the subscription service compared to competitors?
- What’s the P&L factoring in free delivery + cashback?
- What team do you expect to make the roadmap feasible? It’s quite ambitious.
    - At the same time, the timeline for live order tracking is way too long.
- Why so many features in one PRD?
- Why didn’t you use a database for the backlog in Notion instead of a basic table?
    - Why didn’t you use a better tool to manage the backlog & master plan/timeline (e.g., Shortcut)?
