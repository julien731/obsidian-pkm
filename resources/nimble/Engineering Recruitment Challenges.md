# Engineering Recruitment Challenges

# Introduction

The Engineering challenges need to be updated to test for more realistic scenarios. As of now, it is too focused on testing how candidates solve a couple of specific problems rather than assessing whether they can deliver a full-fledged project as we normally do.

What we should be testing for are real-life scenarios that reflect what we do on a day-to-day basis.

While I don’t intend to tell how we should be testing Engineers (nor do I have the technical skills to do so) I believe we need to align the challenges with the skills (both hard skills and communication skills), attitude, and expertise that we need when working on real client projects.

# Web

[Web - Technical Challenge](https://www.notion.so/Web-Technical-Challenge-c6685e2477d54865b119792b1731d115?pvs=21) 

| **Opportunity** | **Example** |
| --- | --- |
| Testing for how people handle frontend performance. | Jollibee web. Given non-optimized assets, how would the candidate implement? |
| Checking how practical their choice of tools/frameworks. | Picking the wrong framework (Tailwind) on Flexi. |
| Efficiency with simple features. | Creating lots of basic CRUDs (e.g., Okya). |
| Basic/fundamental infra skills. | App deployment should be mandatory. |

## Thought Process

Here are the high-level steps that we need/encounter in almost every project and for which we should assess candidates.

| **Step** | **Assessment** | Ideas |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Create a high-level project plan | - Can create work.
- Can communicate plans. | Create a high-level backlog for your work in the tool of your choice (e.g., Github Project, Shortcut). |
| Implement some UI | - Practical choice of tools/frameworks. |  |
| Optimize a frontend | - Attention to details.
- Strives for performance.
- Sticks to standards.
- Some thoughts about accessibility is a bonus. |  |
| Create some CRUDs | - Efficiency in creating simple things. |  |
| Integrate with an API | - Clean architecture.
- Finds ways to work with the data provided (depends on what API we’d ask to integrate). |  |
| Add some logic | - Check their coding skills. |  |
| Add some common features | - Ensure they don’t reinvent the wheel. | Find feature which would typically be solved by using an existing library. Authentication? |
| Develop an API | - Thinks about versioning.
- Security practices. |  |
| Deploy an app | - Candidate can go end-to-end.
- Sensible choice of infra.
- Bonus for IaC.
- Has a safe release process. |  |
