# New Team Organization

[Spotify's Failed #SquadGoals](https://www.jeremiahlee.com/posts/failed-squad-goals/)

# Team Lead

The team lead position not being an "official" one has several drawbacks:

- Less meaning
    - In the company (i.e., no difference between a team lead and a non-team lead)
    - Personally (they can't put team lead on their resume)
- Less accountability: because team leads rotate and because it's not an official position and because there is no difference between a team lead and a regular developer there is no more accountability on the team lead than on others (e.g., Ankit on the CX project)

# Engineering vs. Team Lead

Within the Engineering team, the difference is quite clear. Outside of it, though, it's a different story. PMs struggle to understand:

- Who to talk to for project planning
- Who to talk to for project problems/issues
- Who to escalate to if a problem persists
