# Agile Workflow

## Defining Types

- Module
    - Epic
        - User Story
        - Chore
        - Bug

### The Login Example

To illustrate all levels of information used in the Agile process, let's take a simplified example of a login feature.

## Bugs & Chores Estimation

With the elements defined in the section above, let's talk about estimating the bugs and chores.

### Why Estimating Those?

Without estimation, it is impossible to plan a realistic sprint, and it is impossible to review the team velocity. On paper, fixing a bug or completing a chore equals no work done.

### What Would It Change?

As of today, when doing sprint planning, we either:

- Plan fewer points than the known team velocity to cover bugs and chores, or,
- Plan with the known team velocity in mind and end up having to try and squeeze bugs/chores in the sprint.

The main changes would be:

- CON: A bit more planning work for developers (e.g. plan chores in advance, estimate the work),
- PRO: A more accurate sprint.

## Who Benefits?

In short: everyone.

The benefits would be more with bigger projects like The 1, but small projects would benefit as well.

- Less rush for the developers who don't have to commit to a sprint with an unknown workload,
- Less pressure for PMs who don't get surprises with the sprint size,
- Less disappointments for the client who sees a more reliable plan.

### Tracker Says We Shouldn't Estimate Those

[Yes, it's true.](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/help/articles/planning_with_velocity/#bugs-and-chores-arent-estimable-by-default)

While I do understand the reasoning and actually like their opinionated view, I think that it would still be beneficial for us to estimate.

If we were a product company, my opinion would likely be different. However, we work with clients, and clients want timelines. Always. With estimated chores & bugs comes more realistic timelines.

Yes, I hate talking about timelines, but we often don't have a choice.

### How Do I Estimate A Bug?

It's the main question for me, and I don't have an answer to it. Bugs often require investigation before an estimation can be made, if at all possible. If pre-investigation is being made, then how to account for the time?

As of now, I see two ways to deal with it:

- If the bug is fairly simple to understand, estimate roughly. If not, overestimate to the max (e.g. 8 points).
- Create a framework based on experience, project, affected application component(s), affected users, and systematize bugs estimation. I do believe that this could be simpler that what it sounds.

## What Next?

This is obviously a long piece and I'm hoping that it will bring consensus-ish. Not because my opinion matters most, but because all of the above is reflecting previous (long) conversations. I'm also making concessions with my own opinions just to make it clear.

I propose the next steps as being:

- If you agree with everything or can live with some concessions, then thumbs up this comment;
- If you strongly disagree with all or some of the above, then thumbs down and voice your concerns.

If the thumbs vote is positive, then we all agree to start estimating bugs & chores and the last step before documenting it will be to agree on the methodology for estimating bugs.
