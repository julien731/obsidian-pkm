# All Hands - Q2 2025

- What ownership means and the consequences of a lack of ownership.
    - Carlos had to get mad about easyHotel
    - I had to get mad about JB web
    - This doesn’t make anyone happy (including Carlos and I) but, unfortunately, it’s necessary.
    - Ownership means that the team should:
        - Identify any issue and suspicious activity
        - Care about it
        - Set the correct sense of urgency
        - Act on it
    - Take pride in your work. If the performance of the app you develop is bad, how can you be proud of your work?
