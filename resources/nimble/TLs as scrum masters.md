# TLs as scrum masters

El or tl should act as the scrum master

Be accountable for a sprint delivery. Do a mini retro during sprint planning.

Pms can't always explain why the team is slow. TL needs to take more accountability.

TL should join sprint review with clients. They need to face the consequences.
