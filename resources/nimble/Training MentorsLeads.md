# Training Mentors/Leads

- Set very clear expectations for the direction each role should take
    - Requires a track so that leads can steer their reports in the correct direction in accordance with the expectations from the track
    - From there, leads can figure out the best way forward with their reports regarding growth, objectives, areas to improve, methodology… basically whatever they can think of as long as it brings their reports in the correct direction set by the track
    - It will also avoid me being annoyed if I don’t see a lead taking the same approach as me. As long as their reports progress then their style is valid just as much as mine
    - Do we have too many processes to enable that? Does it give them enough freedom?
    - Maybe refocus more on objectives
    - Link existing processes to objectives for growth. Those can then be set as goals for subordinates perpetuating a cycle of self-development because it’s always the same type of objective but at different levels of difficulty
