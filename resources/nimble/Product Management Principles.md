# Product Management Principles

# General

- Figure out the business goals for each client. Use those as the main guiding principle for decision-making.
- Always make the decisions that will bring the highest value to the client at the time.
- Take immediate action when action is necessary. The more you wait, the bigger the issue will become.
- Use your stack to the fullest. It will make you more productive and prevent you from wasting time (e.g., duplicating content).
- Be reliable. There can be times when you're busy, on vacation, or out sick. However, it doesn't mean you can leave the team in the dark without any directives or contingency plans.
- Whatever you do, do it to the best of your abilities. "Good enough" is *not* good enough for our team.
- If you see something incorrect or below the expected level of quality, even if it's not your work, project, team, or domain, raise it. Fix it if you can.

Move with urgency and focus.

# Backlog Organization

- Use data to manage your backlog (e.g., burndown, velocity, cycle time). Otherwise, you're just guessing.
- Prepare the entire product backlog at the start of the project unless there is a hard blocker. Otherwise, you won't have visibility of your progress.

# Rules

(1) always act in the best interests of the company, (2) never do anything that makes it harder for others to achieve their goals, (3) do whatever you can to achieve your own goals.
