# WFH Pros & Cons

# Remote-First (With Office)

- People
    - No commute, more productivity.
    - Less distractions, more productivity.
    - Office optimized for comfort for when people come over (thanks to a  reduced need to optimize for capacity).
- Processes
    - Forces all teammates to communicate better: more though out ideas, more structured communication, leading to less interruptions and more productive discussions.
    - More traceability of information as everyone is forced to rely on written communication more.
    - Could lead to increased efforts in documenting things.
    - Forces more structured workflows, and following those workflows, so that everyone can know the status of projects at any time.
- Finances
    - Less expenses for the office.
    - Reduced kitchen budget.
- Efficiency
    - Easy to get on a video call when needed but internet might not always be great for everyone.

<aside>
💡 Some people will translate WFH to remote work and will, sometimes, work from non-home locations (e.g. hotel). The following section outlines options to adapt to both modes should this be deemed acceptable.

# Office-First

- People
    - Office optimized for capacity.
    - Watercooler effect.
    - Comfortable workspace for all is ensured.
    - Easier to track people's health & state of mind.
- Processes
    - No "physical" incentive to improve processes and strictly adhere to them.
- Finances
    - Linear need to increase the office size.
    - Upfront investment to transform the office in a "hub" space.
- Efficiency
    - Easier to chat with colleagues when required to solve problems or brainstorm.

# WFH Velocity

- Braive has been stable.
- MIA showed a very slight decrease (1/2 points), but it has continued until now so it might not be WFH-related.
- The 1 is impossible to analyze as the backlog is too messy (blockers and non-ready stuff)

# Notes

- How to onboard and provide the hardware?
