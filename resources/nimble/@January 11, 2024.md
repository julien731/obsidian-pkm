- How do you believe a TA team should fit within the overall company structure? With which other areas do you see overlap and collaboration?
    - TA should connect with the company goals.
        - Get information for the leaders. Maybe HR leaders.
    - Need to understand the requirements to hire the best candidates.
    - Some companies have TA handle onboarding. She thinks it’s the right approach.
    - TA is not about how many people we can recruit, it’s about how many people we can retain.
- As a lead, how would you approach reorganizing the TA structure within the company?
- Who do you see as your main stakeholders?
    1. HR manager.
        - Weekly catch-up.
    2. Hiring managers.
        - Intake meeting for new roles to understand the role, selling points, timeline.
    3. Department leads.
        - All hands meetings.
        - They define the strategies and goals which is important for TA to know. This is usually quite stable so it’s more of a quarterly or yearly alignment.

## Challenge

- You outlines many metrics to watch in your challenge. Would you monitor them all?
    - What actions would you take based on all those metrics?
- Question 3 sounds more like cookie-cutter suggestions.
    - Based on what you know of our recruitment process (including what you have gone through yourself), **what would you change in order to improve both quantity and quality of applicants?**
- Found some inconsistencies in the formatting of our job openings on LinkedIn.
    - Some openings have expectations, others not, some have intro, some don’t.
    - She did not check anything further than LinkedIn.

## Notes

- Communication is really difficult. Both speaking and understanding.
- She needs to be much more straightforward. She tends to take a very long route to answer questions. I got lost a few times.
- She seems low-tech. Shared her entire screen and opened the challenge from her email attachment.
- Lacks drive and ownership. Especially for a lead position.
    - Her challenge is very generic rather than specific to *our* company and *our* process. It’s basically a laundry list. Examples:
        - Ease of application through mobile devices. She reckons that it’s a general recommendation and that it was easy to apply through mobile for Nimble.
        - The worst is question 3. The requirement is to analyze our recruitment process but she just built a laundry list of things. I asked, for some of the points, if she felt we did not do good enough (e.g., communication), but she said no it was good.
            - Same for “quick response” she right away said that she thinks Nimble does it well. Exact same for “interviewing tips.”
    - LinkedIn Recruiter: can’t this be found through LinkedIn if we already have it?
    - She repeated multiple times that she does not know the company goals. At the lead level, I would have liked to see some assumptions made from her and her challenge to be more targeted.
