I've had leather jackets most of my life and this may be my favorite! From reviews I was really concerned about it being too small, but I used the size chart and it fits great! I am 6'2 and about 230 lbs and the XL worked for me. I was also concerned that it might be stiff, cold, cheaply made or any number of other things you can get when you order clothes online but I was pleasantly surprised at how the leather was soft, the inside was warm and comfortable.

I have two caveats but they do not affect my rating. One is that the zipper handles were put on the left side, which is opposite from normal for male clothes. I thought that was weird and a little inconvenient, but not a deal breaker. The other is that the sleeves are a bit too long. Again, not a huge deal. I'd much rather they were too long than too short.

Also, I am not a motorcycle guy so it doesn't bother me that there are a couple zippers for looks only (fake pockets) on the front.

Overall, I am loving this jacket and look forward to getting a lot of use out of it!

Beautiful! I have a 41in. Chest and this jacket is Good for riding motorcycles. I dont know what others mean but ALL pockets ARE functional! It has a beautiful suade look and feel. It doesnt smell like typical leather watch straps but still real leather. One sad part is that it does get dirty fast. As long as you have a special REAL leather SUADE cleaner you'll be fine! This jacket get MANY compliments. People assume it costs more than what you paid for. And it is a bit heavy. Which I love and perfer. It makes me feel like a man. And each time i think how heavy it is, just reminds me how manly I am. Jk this jacket is a MUST. All the photos you see are natural lighting besides the selfie. Update: I've used this in the rain MANY times and still is good! With no cracks or splits. The edges have a nice leather warn look which looks even better the more I wear it. This jacket will jacket will age beautifully well! This is hog pig suede leather ( genuine leather) it's obvious that's its not nubuck leather/ full grain or top grain leather. There for, it wont be that strong when it comes to a motorcycle slide fall. Dont get me wrong it WILL PROTECT you if you fall. For the price you cant complain. It WILL get the job done well. This jacket protects up to 50 degrees farenheit which is pretty good if you live in south California like me. This jacket is lined with polyester(inside of the jackets material). So it's not that great if you use it strictly for the cold. I do feel this jacket is very well made. If this jacket was made from a mainstream brand (hugo boss) it would cost 500 to 600 bucks easy. Your getting a whole load of jacket for the price. This is a NGJ (a no girl jacket) is jacket is so scrumptious that you would not want to let a girl use this jacket. Especially if it's the first date. You may never get it back from her. please so your self a favor and keep a jacket you dont care about I'm your car so she can use. Maybe keep. Please dont give anyone your jackets! (Unless shes a real girlfriend or wife). I will be buying a second jacket that's black. Not sure if I'll buy it medium or large again. I normal wear medium shirts and this jackets fits pretty good with a large. Plus you can layer it for the cold of you do get it slightly larger. This jacket is a must get it before they increase the price! (Hope they don't) and the jacket is made in india for those who care about where it's made.

I’m a long-time Amazon shopper, have ridden motorcycles for 40 years, and have owned a couple dozen or more leather jackets through the years. This purchase has motivated me to write my first-ever product review.

First, this is NOT a motorcycle jacket. As noted in other reviews, the leather is pig skin and way too thin to provide any serious protection from road rash. The jacket doesn’t even look much like a motorcycle jacket, so I’m not sure where the manufacturer got the idea of calling it such. I knew before ordering that it lacked credibility as riding apparel, but I didn’t buy it for that purpose. I bought it because I love leather jackets and this one looks cool.

It was a gamble ordering a $150 piece of clothing made in China based on photos and reviews alone, and I was skeptical that a leather jacket at this price point would be much good, but I was blown away when It arrived. Taking into consideration both quality and cost, this is one of the best leather jackets I’ve ever owned, certainly the best value. The quality of the workmanship matches or exceeds that of jackets costing 2 or 3 times more, making it a bargain buy. China may produce a lot of cheap crap clothing, but this jacket proves they can also do it right, as good as anyone, at an unbeatable price. If you’re looking for an affordable, well-made and stylish (and warm) jacket for everyday use, go for it. Highly recommended!
