## The Idea
Instead of documenting products in a separate tool like Jira or Shortcut, what if we documented in the project repo directly? This gives direct access for LLMs, and it makes it easier to update, keep up-to-date, and break down for implementation.

## Why It Matters
- Better workflow when working with LLMs
- More context available from the same place
- Easier to update when implementation changes

## Open Questions
- Would this work well with the PR review process?
- How would this work with clients?
