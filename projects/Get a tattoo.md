# Get a tattoo

Resources: All Day Tattoo (../Second%20Brain/Resources/All%20Day%20Tattoo%2046321e36d80b42e08dfd8acc7b51ea8b.md), Common Ground Tattoo (../Second%20Brain/Resources/Common%20Ground%20Tattoo%200e6780999cac49f0a70606b110840a15.md)

# Why

I have a warrior spirit and I am competitive. I used to fight to win in sports (fencing). I was an athlete. Now, I fight to win in my career (and I’m winning). Life & work stopped me from being an athlete. I want this tattoo to be a constant reminder to push myself, keep up the fight, and be an athlete again.

# Expected Outcome

A medium shoulder tattoo.
