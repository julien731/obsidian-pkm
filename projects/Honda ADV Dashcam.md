# Honda ADV Dashcam

Resources: BlueSkySea DV988 - Unboxing and Installation - Part 1 (../Second%20Brain/Resources/BlueSkySea%20DV988%20-%20Unboxing%20and%20Installation%20-%20Par%206a03f7d33ee24478b54d7ce7434c7630.md)

# Why

Tanny got (gently) rear-ended on the road. It's a situation where a dashcam would help in case there are actual damages on the bike.

# Expected Outcome

Dashcam setup and functional for both front and rear.

# Notes

- Need to find the ACC (always on) power connection
- If not possible, tap into the fust box using a tap adapter
