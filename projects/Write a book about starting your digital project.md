# Write a book about starting your digital project

Resources: Starting your digital project (../Second%20Brain/Resources/Starting%20your%20digital%20project%20f6ade4e803e94fcb99747d0dad9042b0.md), Short and clear pseudo-user stories example (../Second%20Brain/Resources/Short%20and%20clear%20pseudo-user%20stories%20example%2026f77feb54a54c75a9d89e4c8e0ee76f.md)

# Why

The vast majority of our clients have no idea how to actually get started with their project. Worse, some of them put visible efforts in preparing several-pages-long documents that practically unusable and focusing on technical details without ever getting to the problem at hand and the expected solution.

# Expected Outcome

- Check how writing an e-book works.
- Check how selling on Amazon works.
- Write a guide to preparing your (enterprise) digital project possibly to have a vendor develop your application (actually, *solve your problem*).

# Notes

- Write from the point of view of the client (see [Simply Said: Communicating Better at Work and Beyond](../Second%20Brain/Books/Simply%20Said%20Communicating%20Better%20at%20Work%20and%20Beyon%202c9257d4766644b1968046af755a061f.md))
    - Save money on your project, prepare it the right way
    - Get your project delivered on time, plan for a successful delivery
