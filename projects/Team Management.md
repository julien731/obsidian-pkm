# Why?

Working for a consultancy and having to regularly rotate project teams and assemble new project teams, it became a headache to know who was available and who wasn't, who would be a good fit for a specific project, who works well with who.

Overall, assembling a new project team was a painful exercise. It was also very inefficient, and it was slowing down business as there was no clear visibility on the company's current capacity.

## The Hard Questions

- Who's working on which project?
    - Who's billed and who isn't?
- Who's available for a new project?
    - Who has the proper skills for this new project?
    - (Who's working well with who?)
- Who was working on which project during that time?
- How can I do a team rotation?
- Simulate a team rotation/change
