# Consuming Content More Effectively

Resources: The 5 Magical Apps That Changed My Life (../Second%20Brain/Resources/The%205%20Magical%20Apps%20That%20Changed%20My%20Life%2074b4bdf2c80141ebb11228278447bfb0.md)

# Why

I consume a lot of content every day. E-mail newsletters, videos, articles, etc. However, all the valuable information and knowledge is usually non-persistent and the value of the time spent consuming content is kind of lost.

# Expected Outcome

Develop and implement a system for increasing the effectiveness of my content consumption time.
