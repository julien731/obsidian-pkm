# Video Conferencing Hardware

Resources: I turned an old tablet into a smart meeting room display with this self-hosted app (../Second%20Brain/Resources/I%20turned%20an%20old%20tablet%20into%20a%20smart%20meeting%20room%20d%2026f37367d0b381ecab13c59cb8921c97.md)

# Why

Video conferencing setup/hardware is a bit of a pain, especially when using multiple services. The hardware is expensive and it’s not seamless to switch between providers.

# Expected Outcome

- Hardware setup.
- Software setup.
- Meeting room management (with a screen to display room bookings per room).

# Notes

- Explore using RPi
