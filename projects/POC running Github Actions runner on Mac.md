# POC running Github Actions runner on Mac

Resources: Adding a self-hosted runner to a repository (../Second%20Brain/Resources/Adding%20a%20self-hosted%20runner%20to%20a%20repository%201d037367d0b38024a097f2f5f24634db.md), gh-signoff (../Second%20Brain/Resources/gh-signoff%201de37367d0b38092b14dd0124a12206e.md)

# Why

Running CI/CD using Github Actions and MacStadium is too slow and too costly. Given the price of a Mac Mini, we could pay it back in a couple of months (especially if we charge clients) and it would build faster.

# Expected Outcome

- POC on the Nimble website
