# EL <> PM exchange program


# Why

Engineering Leads must be able to communicate well with stakeholders and handle sometimes stressful situations. Most of them aren't used to that but PMs are.

On the other hand, PMs need to be technical. Some are more technical than others and it would be nice for PMs to have some guidance from an experienced Engineer (EL).

What about having some sort of program where an EL can benefit from the guidance of a PM, and PMs can benefit from the guidance of an EL?

# Expected Outcome

Define what the project completion should achieve.
