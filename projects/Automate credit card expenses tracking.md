# Automate credit card expenses tracking

Resources: n8n (../Second%20Brain/Resources/n8n%2022c37367d0b3803a82ffe8799b36e11c.md)

# Why

To make paying credit card simpler and faster.

# Expected Outcome

All credit card transactions are tracked somewhere so that there is no doubt about what’s what.

# Notes

- Tag emails? Can I use LINE (would be more reliable)?
- Check n8n for workflow to extract necessary information.
- Push where? Notion? Airtable? Teable?
