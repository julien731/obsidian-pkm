# Vault Gardening — 2026-03-01

Weekly maintenance run. Summary below.

## Inbox Processed (2 notes)

- **Tags added**: `#ai #framework #developer-tools #feedback`
- **Linked to**: `[[projects/Argus]]`, `[[resources/SNAIPE - Spec-driven Nimble AI Product Engine]]`

- **Tags added**: `#ai #framework #developer-tools #nimble #brainstorm`
- **Linked to**: `[[projects/Argus]]`

## New Notes via Git Pull (4 — already correctly placed)

4 new notes landed in `resources/glowcheck/` from the pull:
- `Tanny & Inae Debrief Agenda.md`
- `Tanny & Julien's Debrief Meeting Summary.md`
- `Tanny & Julien's Debrief Meeting Summary Transcript.md`
- `Tanny's Korea Exploration Trip Debrief.md`

These are correctly placed in `resources/glowcheck/`. No action needed, but consider linking them from a Glowcheck area note if one doesn't exist yet.

## Orphan Check

31 project notes have **zero incoming wikilinks**. Most are legacy notes from the Jan 2026 Notion migration. High-priority ones to link or archive:

**Likely still active — wire up to Projects Board:**
- `Areeya Retreat - Airbnb Management App.md` (active project, should be on Projects Board)
- `AI resume screening for new Recruitee applications.md`
- `Team Management.md`
- `WordPress CX Loyalty Suite.md`

**Likely dormant/backlog — consider archiving:**
- `Baseball cards.md`, `Flying.md`, `Wedding.md`, `Product Shirts.md`
- `Frangipani Bonsai.md`, `Ambilight TV.md`, `Living Wall.md`

**Home lab cluster (could be linked together):**
- `Setup a home lab.md`, `Setup Frigate on NAS.md`, `Configure Frigate on the NAS to store CCTV footage.md`, `Setup local backups for NAS.md`, `Setup off-site NAS backups.md`, `Setup solid backups for Proxmox.md`, `Setup NUT on spare RPi for living room UPC.md`, `Define 3-2-1 data backup strategy.md`

**Nimble/work cluster:**
- `Product Manager Track.md`, `Product Manager Fellowship.md`, `Product Manager Charm School.md`, `Use LCI in PM training path.md`, `EL PM exchange program.md`, `Create a course to become a Technical Product Mana.md`

## Stale Projects (30+ days, no activity)

57 out of 59 project notes haven't been touched since **Jan 19, 2026** (the Notion migration date). The only active projects are:
- `Argus.md` (last: 2026-02-23) ✅
- `Areeya Retreat - Airbnb Management App.md` (last: 2026-02-18) ✅

**Recommended review:** Triage the 57 stale projects into: Still active | Archive | Someday/Maybe. The Projects Board Kanban is essentially empty (only Argus is on it).

## Suggested Next Actions

1. [ ] Add `Areeya Retreat - Airbnb Management App` to the Projects Board (In Progress)
2. [ ] Do a 30-min triage of the 57 stale projects: active → board, dead → archive/
3. [ ] Create a Glowcheck area note in `areas/` to link the 4 new glowcheck resources
4. [ ] Wire the home lab projects together with a parent note or hub
5. [ ] Wire the PM training cluster together under `Product Manager Track.md`
