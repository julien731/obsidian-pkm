# Weekly Vault Gardening — February 22, 2026

## 1. Inbox Processing (11 notes)

### 🔴 Actionable / Needs Decision

**`2025 Yearly Performance Reviews.md`**
→ Move to: `resources/nimble/2025 Performance Review Matrix.md`
- Tags to add: `#nimble #people-ops #reviews #performance`
- Links: [[Andrew]], [[Vu]], [[Julien V.]]
- Note: Contains the 360 review matrix. File under nimble resources with the existing EOY Speech notes.

**`2026 EOY Speech.md`**
→ Move to: `resources/nimble/2026 EOY Speech.md`
- Tags to add: `#nimble #leadership #speech`
- Links: [[resources/nimble/2023 EOY Speech]], [[resources/nimble/2025 EOY Speech]]
- Note: Very thin stub — only one line. Flesh out before moving or leave in inbox until it develops.

**`How do I leverage my team to build a better, stronger business?.md`**
→ Move to: `journal/reflections/`
- Tags to add: `#leadership #management #reflection`
- Links: [[projects/Team Management]], [[people/Vu]], [[people/Andrew]]
- Note: This is a leadership reflection, fits the pattern of existing reflection notes in `journal/reflections/`.

**`What's my master plan?.md`**
→ Move to: `journal/reflections/` or `projects/Write a Personal Mission Statement.md`
- Tags to add: `#reflection #vision #personal`
- Links: [[projects/Write a Personal Mission Statement]], [[projects/Go on a Solo Retreat]]
- Note: Big-picture life question — strongly related to the "Write a Personal Mission Statement" project already in projects/.

### 🟡 Resources (process & file)

**`Dexter - Financial Research Agent.md`**
→ Move to: `resources/Dexter - Financial Research Agent.md`
- Tags: already well-tagged (`#ai #agent #finance #research #open-source`) ✅
- Links: [[projects/Get AI-based investment recommendations]], [[projects/Try out OpenBB]]
- Note: Good quality capture with full frontmatter. Ready to move as-is.

**`Everything Claude Code - Complete Config Collection.md`**
→ Move to: `resources/Everything Claude Code - Complete Config Collection.md`
- Tags: already tagged ✅
- Links: [[resources/Automatic Clawdbot Token Optimization Configuration]], [[resources/Productivity Docker Containers]]
- Note: AI/dev tooling resource — fits cleanly in resources/.

**`OpenClaw Headless Browser Setup.md`**
→ Move to: `resources/OpenClaw Headless Browser Setup.md`
- Tags to add: `#openclaw #browser #homelab #automation`
- Links: [[resources/Automatic Clawdbot Token Optimization Configuration]], [[resources/Productivity Docker Containers]]
- Note: Operational how-to for OpenClaw on headless Linux. Good pair with the token optimization guide.

**`OpenClaw Token Optimization Guide.md`**
→ Move to: `resources/OpenClaw Token Optimization Guide.md`
- Tags to add: `#openclaw #ai #productivity #config`
- Links: [[resources/Automatic Clawdbot Token Optimization Configuration]], [[resources/OpenClaw Headless Browser Setup]]
- Note: Pairs with the existing "Automatic Clawdbot Token Optimization Configuration" resource.

**`The Psychology of Premium Websites.md`** *(new this week, just pulled)*
→ Move to: `resources/The Psychology of Premium Websites.md`
- Tags to add: `#design #ux #psychology #web-design`
- Links: [[resources/Design Brief]], [[resources/Design Brief 2]], [[resources/Code Clean]]
- Note: Rich YouTube summary with 3 core principles. Good design reference.

**`Entire.md`**
→ Move to: `resources/Entire.md`
- Tags: already tagged (`#tools #to-review`) ✅
- Note: Thin stub with just a link. Consider reviewing https://entire.io before finalizing the note. Low priority.

### 🟢 Consume & Archive / Delete

**`Instagram Reels to Review.md`**
→ This is a transient todo list, not a knowledge note.
- Suggestion: Review the 3 reels, then delete this note (it says "manually process and move/delete when done").
- Do NOT move to resources — it has no reusable knowledge value.

---

## 2. Orphan Check

**Most orphaned resources are expected** — the `resources/` folder is a reference library and rarely cross-linked. This is normal Obsidian behavior for clipped articles.

### 🔴 Surprising Orphans Worth Connecting

**Active areas/ — all 6 notes have no incoming links:**
- `areas/2026 Team Goals.md` → Should be linked from the people notes: [[people/Andrew]], [[people/Vu]], [[people/Julien V.]], [[people/Aiden]]
- `areas/2026 Team Goals Analysis.md` → Should link to `areas/2026 Team Goals.md`
- Individual goals files (Andrew Design, Julien V Product, Vu Head of Product) → Cross-link to team goals + people notes

**`journal/reflections/` — 12 notes, none linked:**
- These are valuable leadership reflections. Consider adding a `journal/reflections/index.md` or linking from relevant project notes.

**`people/` — all 7 people notes orphaned:**
- [[people/Aiden]], [[people/Andrew]], [[people/Carlos]], [[people/Julien V.]], [[people/Mai]], [[people/Vu]], [[people/Zach]]
- Should be linked from: team goals, meeting notes, 1-on-1 templates
- Quick win: link people files from the relevant `areas/2026 Goals - {Name}.md` file

**`ideas/` — 5 notes, none linked:**
- `ideas/Areeya Retreat - Airbnb Management App.md` → link to `resources/Airbnb Host Tools - Market Research.md`
- `ideas/ESP32 AI Face - Physical Agent Presence.md` → link to projects/homelab area
- `ideas/Paperless-GPT - AI Layer for Paperless-ngx.md` → link to `projects/Digitize documents.md`

**Duplicate resource note detected:**
- `resources/Obsidian + Cursor AI- Organize 2,000+ Notes in 10 Minutes (Tutorial).md`
- `resources/Obsidian + Cursor AI Organize 2,000+ Notes in 10 M.md`
- These appear to be duplicates (same topic, one with dash/hyphen). Consider merging or deleting one.

**Stub projects with no content:**
- `projects/New Project.md` — empty template, no title or content. Delete or rename.
- `projects/New Work Project.md` — same. Migrated Notion stub with no actual content.

---

## 3. Stale Projects (30+ days without edit)

**All 58 projects** in `projects/` have a last-modified date of January 19, 2026 (33 days ago) — this is the Notion migration date. This means no projects have been actively updated in Obsidian since migration.

**This is a critical signal:** either the vault isn't being used for active project tracking yet, or project notes need to be reviewed and pruned.

### Priority Review Candidates (pick 5 to triage first)

| Project | Suggested Action |
|---|---|
| `Write a Personal Mission Statement.md` | Start — related to inbox note "What's my master plan?" |
| `Go on a Solo Retreat.md` | Time-sensitive — schedule or drop |
| `Team Management.md` | Active work area — update with current state |
| `Product Manager Track.md` | Large file (5KB) — likely has actionable content |
| `Build a House in Bang Kobua.md` | Large file (4.5KB) — long-horizon, worth reviewing status |

### Candidates to Archive or Close

- `New Project.md` — empty stub → **delete**
- `New Work Project.md` — empty stub → **delete**
- `Product Shirts.md` — very small, unclear status
- `Baseball cards.md` — unclear if active
- `Prepare a meal plan.md` — recurring task, not a project

## 4. Summary & Recommended Actions

### This Week (high value, low effort)
1. **Move 8 inbox notes** to resources/ (Dexter, Everything Claude Code, OpenClaw x2, The Psychology of Premium Websites, Entire, 2025 Performance Reviews, 2026 EOY Speech)
2. **Move 2 inbox notes** to journal/reflections/ (team leverage question, master plan question)
3. **Delete Instagram Reels** note after watching the 3 reels
4. **Delete or rename** `projects/New Project.md` and `projects/New Work Project.md`

### This Week (medium effort)
5. **Add links** from `areas/2026 Goals - *.md` to the corresponding `people/` notes
6. **Merge duplicate** Obsidian + Cursor AI resource notes
7. **Open 5 stale projects** and update their status (completed/archived/active)

### Longer Term
8. Create a `journal/reflections/index.md` to surface the 12 reflection notes
9. Consider a dedicated `areas/Leadership.md` hub note to link management reflections, people notes, and team goals
10. Review all 58 projects — the migration brought in everything from Notion; now is the time to decide what's still real
