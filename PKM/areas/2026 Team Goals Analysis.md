## Alignment Analysis

### Strong Alignment (All 4 leaders)

| Theme | Summary |
|-------|---------|
| **AI adoption** | End-to-end AI workflows, Figma Make, speed gains, mandatory skill |
| **Quality issues** | Rush periods degraded quality; known issues not fixed with urgency |
| **Client relationships** | Weak ties to decision-makers; passive order-taking; late escalation |

### Moderate Alignment (2-3 leaders)

| Theme | Who |
|-------|-----|
| Communication & escalation | Julien, [[people/Vu]] |
| Discovery/context-gathering | Julien, [[people/Andrew]] |
| Designer-PM collaboration | [[people/Andrew]], [[people/Julien V]], [[people/Vu]] |
| Training & career paths | Julien, [[people/Andrew]] |

### Unique Perspectives

| Leader | Unique Points |
|--------|---------------|
| [[people/Andrew]] | Over-reliance on copying competitors; user testing at 3 stages; stricter onboarding |
| [[people/Julien V]] | Analytics proficiency (Metabase, NewRelic); blocked access to real users |
| [[people/Vu]] | Resource management pain; cross-team sharing gaps; "wartime" PM skills |

## Six Priority Areas for 2026

### 1. Restore Quality as Core Differentiator

- Establish non-negotiable quality gates
- Designers must continuously test implementations
- Clear escalation triggers and timelines
- Quality under pressure is a skill, not an exception

### 2. Transform Client Relationships

- Map key stakeholders (decision-makers, influencers)
- Build direct relationships with senior contacts
- Require business context and roadmaps before accepting work
- Adopt consultative stance; push back on low-value requests
- KPI: PMs hear bad news first

### 3. Operationalize AI Across Workflows

- **Design**: Figma Make framework
- **Product**: AI for PRDs, user stories, test cases
- **Operations**: n8n for resource management
- Standardize what works; make AI proficiency mandatory

### 4. Fix Alignment & Discovery Before Execution

- Alignment checkpoint before design begins
- User stories must include reviewed designs
- Deepen discovery: workflows, constraints, unspoken intent
- Test at three stages: concept, prototype, post-launch

### 5. Build Communication & Strategic Skills

| Skill | Who | Focus |
|-------|-----|-------|
| Strategic communication | All | Ask "why", push back, communicate up/down |
| Analytics | PMs | Metabase, NewRelic queries |
| Product thinking | Designers | Logic over visuals |
| Crisis management | PMs | Handle ambiguity, set direction |

### 6. Improve Team Operations

- Reduce PM QA burden via automation
- AI/n8n for resource management
- Quantifiable onboarding with early warnings
- Clear career paths with measurable milestones

## The 2026 Shift

| From (2025) | To (2026) |
|-------------|-----------|
| Execution partners | Strategic consultants |
| Ad-hoc AI experiments | Standardized AI workflows |
| Relationships with POs | Relationships with decision-makers |
| Quality when time allows | Quality as non-negotiable |
| Independent PM work | Visible, aligned collaboration |
| Shallow discovery | Deep understanding first |

## Alignment Score

All leaders converge on AI, quality, and client relationships. Differences are complementary rather than contradictory. Each leader adds tactical depth to shared strategic priorities.

**Overall alignment: Strong.**
