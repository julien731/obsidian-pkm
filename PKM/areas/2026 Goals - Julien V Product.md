## Contributor

[[people/Julien V]] - Principal Product Manager

## What We Need to Fix

### Level of Influence
- Large corporations (Jollibee) drive product development
- They prioritize worthless features and introduce platforms without consulting us
- Poor decisions cost them and create frustration on our side
- Hard to keep teams motivated when the pattern repeats

### Quality on Jollibee Web
- Application we built from the ground up has performance issues
- If keeping performance in mind doesn't work, PMs may need to push engineering
- May need non-functional requirements (though cumbersome to define)
- Cannot compromise quality because "we only have time" for features

### Designer Testing
- Designers must test apps continuously
- Some feel disconnected from implementation because they stop testing

## What We Need to Accomplish

### Building Influence
- Need to get closer to real users
- On Jollibee: have user reviews and feedback
- CX team blocks direct access to users
- Cannot truly understand frustration or needs

## Skills the Team Needs

### Leveraging AI
- Speed up prototyping, POCs, backlog management, test cases
- Heading in the right direction but everyone does things differently (as of 2025)
- Need to conclude what works for Nimble and what doesn't
- Standardization required

### Analytics Proficiency
- All PMs must become great at analytics
- Learn to query in Metabase, NewRelic, etc.
- Good examples:
  - Roman monitoring JB apps health
  - [[people/Vu]] querying Metabase to push back on features (grace period)
