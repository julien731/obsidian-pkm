## What We Need to Fix

- Not enough visibility on projects status, progress, challenges, and opportunities.
- Not providing visibility to key stakeholders on the value that we provide and deliver.
- QA is taking too much valuable time from Product Managers.
- Weak relationships between Product Managers and key stakeholders i.e., the ones with decision-making power or strong influence. Right now our Product Managers have established relationships primarily with our clients' Product Owners who are at the execution level only. My Product Managers have a much stronger and broader skillset which is not used to its full potential because of those weak relationships.
- We've had lots of tight timelines and rush periods in 2025, and it has resulted in a lower level of quality. Quality is our primary differentiator as a company.
- Mentoring and training is not deep enough, in parts because Product Managers work independently on their projects, which means that tere aren't many opportunities to observe their work, especially with things like communication (the basics like backlog management can be easily checked).
- Project discovery is too weak. Most Product Manager don't know how to do proper discovery when working on potential projects. They tend to be too shallow and to not develop the deep understanding necessary, including on operational workflows, technical constraints, clients' true and, sometimes, unspoken intent.

## What We Need to Accomplish

- End-to-end AI-assisted workflows from sales to pre-sales, to design, product management, development, delivery.
- Restructure projects resources to enable AI insights.
- Provide better training to the team.
- Gain more influence through better relationships with key stakeholders.

## Skills to Develop

- AI proficiency
- Communication with key corporate stakeholders
- Discovery

# From the Team
## Andrew (Design)
### What to fix

1. Misalignment before design starts: We’re often (thinking about OKYA first) moving forward before full alignment to save time. In practice, this usually costs us more time later through rework and corrections. Alignment between Leadership, PMs, and Engineering is essential before tickets enter the design backlog. We should put a simple* system in place to make alignment easier and faster, so it doesn’t get skipped in the name of speed.
2. Passive "order taking" from clients: We need to stop accepting inefficient requests (like with CBTL, JB) without questions. We should start demanding roadmaps and business context more often so we can guide clients toward work that adds value, rather than just reacting to their sudden changes and random demands. Live more by our nature of consultants.
3. Over-reliance on copying competitors: In many cases (like POS), we treat competitors like Toast as the only source of truth. This prevents us from thinking critically or optimizing the experience, and it degrades the team's problem-solving skills.

### What to accomplish

1. Adopt the "Figma Make" workflow: We need to use the new AI-prompting workflow to instantly visualize ideas with PMs. This will drastically cut down time spent on initial drafts and allow more time for refining the logic and solution. Framework was shared during last Design Exchange with the team and pinned for testing across January. Link is [here](https://www.notion.so/Figma-Make-AI-Framework-2bc70938b3098064a294fded740fb5b2?pvs=21).
2. More testing. Possibly at these three key stages:
    - Early concept validation
    - High-fidelity prototype testing
    - Measuring success after launch
3. Clear career paths and goals: Designers need clear growth paths with measurable milestones. They should know what skills to improve, how progress is tracked, and what’s next if they consistently deliver quality work and live by our values.
4. A stricter onboarding roadmap: We need a quantifiable plan to track new hires (like the recent Milan case showed). This will allow managers to spot performance issues early and intervene before it becomes a bigger problem.

### Skills the whole team needs to acquire

1. AI-Prompting Framework mastery: Every designer needs to become proficient with the new framework (link shared above). This is essential for the speed and efficiency of our new workflow.
2. Strategic communication: The team needs to learn how to ask "why" and push back on tasks that lack context. They need to shift from just saying "yes" to acting as consultants who understand the business goal and collaborate on shaping the right solution.
3. Product thinking: We need to move the focus from just visual polish to product logic. Designers need to understand how their solutions function and solve the user's problem, not just how things look purely based on the simple request filed on the backlog. Circling back here on refraining from the “pixel pushers” approach and more about problem solvers.
## Julien V. (Product)
- What we need to fix
    - **Our level of influence** with large corporations, such as Jollibee. They drive product development by prioritizing worthless features and introducing platforms without consulting us. They are at a loss because those poor decisions cost them, and on our side, it creates frustration. In the long run, I think it’s hard to keep the teams motivated to work on the same project when the story repeats itself.
    - **Poor quality on Jollibee web**, an application we built from the ground up: if keeping performance in mind with everything we build doesn’t work, Product Managers may need to push the engineering teams. I’m not a huge fan of non-functional requirements; they can be cumbersome to define, but we might need to. We cannot compromise on quality because “we only have time” for feature development.
    - Designers must test the apps non stop. Too often, some designers feel disconnected from the implementation because they stop testing.

- What we need to accomplish
    - Building influence?
    - We need to get closer to the real users. On Jollibee, we have user reviews, feedback and so one, but the CX team doesn’t allow anyone to reach out to truly understand their frustration or needs.

- Skills that the whole team needs to acquire
    - **Leveraging AI** to speed things up. From prototyping, POCs, to backlog management and creating test cases. I think we’re heading in the right direction, but as of 2025, everyone does things differently. It’s probably best to conclude on what works for Nimble and what does not.
    - All product managers must become great at analytics. Learn to query in Metabase, NewRelic, etc. A great example is how Roman monitor the JB apps health or how Vu queries Metabase to push back on feature such as the “grace period”.
## Vu (Head of Product)
## What we need to fix

**Quality and standard**

- We faced multiple performance and quality issues in multiple projects.
- In those cases, PMs were aware of the issues. However, we didn’t see clear plans and urgency to fix. Timeline is a constraint, but not an excuse. We have signal of compromising the standard.
- We need to fix the mindset and the sense of standard: Product quality must be the key thing, delivering high-standard products in a tight timeline is part of the process.

**Escalation and communication**

- What we saw in JB Web and Jones Salad are shared patterns of not having a close relationship with clients. Both of the issues should have been escalated far earlier, rather than when the crisis happened.
- We empower PMs to take ownership and provide a high level of autonomy when working on projects, so the product/project owner must have a strong sense of crisis and escalate at the right time.
- In fact, the handling cirisis and escalation are key questions in our hiring process. We required it at higher-level PMs, but I think all PMs must improve this.
- JB VN doesn’t want Guest exp, they want to remove it at least in VN

**Isolation between PMs and Designers**

- The issue with the JB Loyalty program is a great example of the disconnection between PMs and designers.
- We are operating with isolation, where the design process is not considered as an integrated part of the solutioning process. As a result, designs usually need to be updated when technical feasibilities come to the picture.
- We need to fix that. User stories must have design references which alreadybeen carefully reviewed.
- If the clients do it the wrong way, we should be clear about our principles and try to educate them.

**Client management**

- Client management and relationships need to be improved, not just day-to-day project collaboration, but PMs need to go further to better build and maintain close relationships with clients. Key qualitative KPI is: PM must be the first oneto receive bad news from the client, not the leadership team.
- This is the foundation to solve the problem of **escalation and communication**
- This is critical, so even a new role needs to be considered. But the best option is still having the PM better handle it.

**Resource Management**

- We all know that resource management (Centauri stuff, people assignment…) is critical path the business.
- We all feel it’s a painful task. And now it heavily depend on a gatekeeper (Julien).
- We need to solve it once to avoid stress when things go off track. An initiative to use AI and n8n, inspired by the n8n reminder recently, is being built with Tony to support support PM on this process.

## What we need to accomplish

**More automation, fewer shallow works, more impactful initiatives**

- To solve all the above issues and improve the quality, PMs need to spend time on fundamental skills, and handle more work outside of project delivery. So, more things to handle.
- We’re lucky that AI and automation are at a new level compared to this time last year.
- So we need to automate **all** shallow work. Things like PRD, user stories must be produced faster with higher quality using AI. Similar to other brainless jobs.
- Individual PMs have more time to focus on the critical mission.

**Cross-team/project communications**

- We have exactly 1 sharing session in 2025: Which is the AI sharing (and it came quite randomly).
- Outcome from that session, at least the Claude skills, transformed the quality of the document. I tested with the Okya AI project, and it’s great.
- So knowledge sharing has significant value. We need to do it more: Start by making the product channel more active by sharing messages. Then, having more short/focus sharing sessions.

**New PMs headcount, higher competencies from existing PMs**

- 2025 strengthens our belief that PM must have a technical background, even a strong knowledge. We need to have more PMs in that direction.
- Hiring will be challenging with our bar. So we need to level up existing PMs.
- We have more time (by having more automation, AI supports) and more sharing → so all PMs need to leverage those things to learn and grow. We need to have urgency to grow, not something that is nice to help.

## Skills that the whole team needs to acquire

**AI enablement**

- 2025, we encourage people to leverage and apply AI. We saw the benefit.
- 2026, this must be the key skill. It’s a mindset shift
- PMs without AI skills can’t build products in the AI era.

**Communication**

- All the issues we want to improve and things we want to achieve root to a fundamental PM skill, which is communication.
- We need to focus on improving all sides of communication: With engineers, with designers, with clients. Both communicating with peers, communicating up, and communicating down.

**Operating in chaos and ambiguity**

- We do a good job in peacetime environments. But during crises, with difficult clients, or in Okya projects. We did not do a good job of setting directions and driving teams.
- It’s not easy to be fair. Hiring will be tough.
- So current PMs need to level up and deliver better jobs during wartime. So when we need to jump into challenging client projects, or support Okya, we can deliver better outcomes.
