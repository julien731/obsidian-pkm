## What We Need to Fix

### Quality and Standard
- Multiple performance and quality issues across projects
- PMs were aware but no clear plans or urgency to fix
- Timeline is a constraint, not an excuse
- Signs of compromising standards
- **Mindset fix needed**: Product quality is the key thing; delivering high-standard products under tight timelines is part of the process

### Escalation and Communication
- JB Web and Jones Salad show shared pattern: not close enough to clients
- Issues should have escalated far earlier, not during crisis
- High autonomy requires strong sense of crisis and timely escalation
- Crisis handling is a hiring question for senior PMs, but all PMs need this skill

### Isolation Between PMs and Designers
- JB Loyalty program exemplifies PM-designer disconnection
- Design process not integrated into solutioning
- Designs updated when technical feasibility emerges
- **Fix**: User stories must have design references already carefully reviewed
- Educate clients who do it wrong about our principles

### Client Management
- Need improvement beyond day-to-day project collaboration
- PMs must build and maintain close client relationships
- **Key KPI**: PM must be first to receive bad news from client, not leadership
- Foundation for solving escalation and communication issues
- New role considered, but best option is PM improvement

### Resource Management
- Centauri, people assignment is critical path for business
- Painful task, heavily dependent on gatekeeper (Julien)
- Initiative with Tony: AI and n8n to support PMs (inspired by n8n reminder)

## What We Need to Accomplish

### More Automation, Fewer Shallow Works, More Impact
- Solving above issues requires PMs to handle more outside project delivery
- AI and automation at new level compared to last year
- **Automate all shallow work**: PRDs, user stories produced faster with AI
- Free up time for critical missions

### Cross-Team/Project Communications
- Only 1 sharing session in 2025 (AI sharing, came randomly)
- Outcome: Claude skills transformed document quality (tested on Okya AI project)
- **Actions**:
  - Make product channel more active
  - More short, focused sharing sessions

### New PM Headcount, Higher Competencies
- 2025 reinforced: PMs must have technical background/strong knowledge
- Hiring challenging with our bar, so level up existing PMs
- More time available (automation, AI) for learning and growth
- **Urgency to grow** is required, not optional

## Skills the Team Needs

### AI Enablement
- 2025: encouraged AI leverage, saw benefits
- 2026: **must be the key skill**, mindset shift required
- PMs without AI skills can't build products in AI era

### Communication
- Root skill for all improvements
- Focus on all sides: engineers, designers, clients
- Peers, up, and down communication

### Operating in Chaos and Ambiguity
- Good in peacetime, struggling in crisis
- Difficult clients, Okya projects: did not set direction well
- Current PMs need to level up for "wartime" scenarios
- Better outcomes on challenging client projects and Okya support
