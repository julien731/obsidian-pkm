# Replace the NAS

Resources: NAS Specs (../Second%20Brain/Resources/NAS%20Specs%2023737367d0b38016b450d2498f1a9771.md)

# Why

The QNAP NAS is getting increasingly frustrating. Logging in from local doesn’t always work. Always reaching the storage pool threshold. HDDs are loud.

# Expected Outcome

- Get a new computer for the NAS.
- Run TrueNAS.
- Ensure it can still stream *at least* 1080p video.
- Must support NVR.
- M2 SSD-based.
