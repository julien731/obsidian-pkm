# Replace Google Photos

Resources: Immich (../Second%20Brain/Resources/Immich%20c9c5e1614e224a50be9892e92ec69e49.md), Immich vs PhotoPrism (../Second%20Brain/Resources/Immich%20vs%20PhotoPrism%20f31ba5d3ef674a398f1f3ed24ec2f07f.md)

# Why

The free Google Workspace plan no longer allows purchasing additional storage space. Users are required to be on a paid plan to buy storage.

The vast majority of the Drive space used is spent on photos (via Google Photos).

In addition, Tanny is paying about 3,000 THB per year in Google storage, primarily for photos as well.

This is an opportunity to consolidate Tanny and my files/photos on a shared service, which could enable cost savings for both of us.

# Expected Outcome

- Figure out a new service or tool for photo storage. It should be close to the Google Photos experience, which is very good.
- Move back to the free Google Drive plan by removing all photos from Google Photos.
- In the case of a local cloud solution (setup on NAS), there must be a cloud backup (e.g., S3).

# Notes

So far, the best alternative seems to be [Immich](https://immich.app/).
