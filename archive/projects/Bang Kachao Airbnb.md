# Why

As part of our second roud of (real estate) investing, we are considering the option to purchase land in Bang Kachao and build a few rental "properties" on it, including luxury "glamping" tents.

# Expected Outcome

The purchasing of a piece of land and the building of a tiny house plus a few glamping tents. The project should generate cash flow in addition to building equity.

# Notes

This idea is an alternative to the [Hua Hin Pool Villa](Hua%20Hin%20Pool%20Villa%2068edbf0daa2b46e29830b248da250079.md) project.
