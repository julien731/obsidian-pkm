# Clean the Trailblazer's Seats

Resources: What’s the Right Way to Clean, Condition & Protect Your Leather? Meguiar’s – Quik Tips (../Second%20Brain/Resources/What%E2%80%99s%20the%20Right%20Way%20to%20Clean,%20Condition%20&%20Protect%209c08beaf55f14c5690cb13ad6ba90216.md), Sticky Leather Car Seats (../Second%20Brain/Resources/Sticky%20Leather%20Car%20Seats%20498c1408f1774a58bf54c7eeb835e9b4.md)

# Why

The car seats are sticky. Based on research, it can be because of oil residue (from use) or because of the use of an unadapted cleaner.

# Expected Outcome

- Non-sticky seats.
- Better looking leather.

# Notes

In order to clean the seats properly, I need:

- A soft brush to clean the seats.
- Laundry detergent (8 parts water to 1 part detergent).
- A microfiber cloth to remove the detergent.
- Vinyl cleaner.
- Leather conditioner.
