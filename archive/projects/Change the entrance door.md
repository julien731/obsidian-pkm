# Change the entrance door

Resources: Ultimate Smart Lock Comparison: the 8 BEST on Amazon! (../Second%20Brain/Resources/Ultimate%20Smart%20Lock%20Comparison%20the%208%20BEST%20on%20Amazo%20edf83773cd2f4f36bd83d23da2fee255.md), Anyone outside of US/Canada using a Yale Assure Lock 2? (../Second%20Brain/Resources/Anyone%20outside%20of%20US%20Canada%20using%20a%20Yale%20Assure%20Lo%205759c52deef744c8bf44e6b4e8219304.md)

# Why

The current door is getting difficult to slide open. While it could be fixed with a new rail, the smart lock is dead, and we were never really happy with it in the first place. With a classic swinging door we will have the ability to use a wider array of smart locks.

# Expected Outcome

- Get a new swinging door.
- Get a new smart lock.
    - The smart lock should integrate with Home Assistant.

# Notes

<aside>
⚠️ The Yale Assure 2 does not work seamlessly outside the US. There will also be no support available as the lock is not officially sold outside the country.
