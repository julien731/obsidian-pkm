# Catch-Up with Leroy

# Agenda

- Expectations from different parties: I find myself producing a lot of artifacts for planning and I'm wondering if this should be handled by the Program Managers.
- I am concerned that we are creating a lot of duplicate content which makes the project harder to track (e.g., the MVP list, several different plans).
- I understand that you and Jamie feel like you don't have enough visibility. I can understand that. What can I do to give you the visibility you need?
- Invoicing.

# Notes

- We should be logging/organizing documentation in Confluence.
- Design feedback: home is functional but we might miss the chance to do something different?
    - Lacks branding.
- Take over the Nimble board.
