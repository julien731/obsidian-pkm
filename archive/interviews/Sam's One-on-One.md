# Sam's One-on-One

- Doing more project management than product management.
- Lots of things to learn on The 1. Taking time. Steep learning curve.
- Neglecting product manager duties (tickets) because of too many things to chase.
- Learning not to rely or trust any party (unfortunately.)
- Feels like performance is sub-standard.
- Unhappy about the PM part. Does not match his expectations, BUT he takes it on because he wants to stick with Nimble.
- Learning how to work with the team.
- Expectation 1st week was unclear
- Be more strict with  versions management on Jira
    - Release versions on time
