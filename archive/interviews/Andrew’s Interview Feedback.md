# Andrew’s Interview Feedback

- May 29, 2024 - Au Duong Tuan
    - You have the introduction under control now. You need a bit more practice to improve the smoothness. It will come with time. Overall you have the right approach.
    - Good follow-up on question 3.
    - Question 4: although most people use Figma these days, don’t assume that everyone does. Leave the tool open.
    - Question 5: I like to ask people to tell me about a mistake they made that they find relevant for the interview. In addition to learning about they mistakes and what they did about it, it also shows how honest they might be, if they try to downplay the mistake, or if they just try to pick an insignificant one to not share a real mistake.

    - Your follow up to question #1 was not very clear. Then her answer was also not very clear. The combination of both led to an answer that was completely besides the point.
    - When candidates ask for very broad or unclear questions (e.g., what’s the decision-making process) just give a short and broad answer. Don’t waste your time on questions that did not take any real thinking from the candidates.

    - Good intro content. Still need to work on the delivery smoothness.
    - Good follow up question on q1 (how do you handle manager when he’s ignoring the team’s opinions).
    - Why did you skip question 3 (what sets you apart)?
    - Your outro was a bit abrupt (I have everything I need do you have any questions?). You need to work on your delivery.

    - Need to get more familiar with the questions so that your delivery is smoother.
    - No need to push too much on (follow-up) questions if the answer is not satisfying (e.g., question about complex user flows). If it looks like it’s a fail you can just move forward.
        - Don’t hesitate to move faster in general when the answers are not at the level.
    - Closing the interview:
        1. Tell the candidate clearly that you’re done with your questions and that you’ve got everything you need.
        2. Then ask them if they have any questions.
    - Do not hesitate to give very simple and short answers to stupid questions (e.g., what do you expect to see from me on the job).
    - “How do you bring out the best in each team member”
        - Check that you understand where they want to go. It serves two purposes:
            - Ensures they have a real question (as opposed to a general question they copied from the internet which they learn nothing from).
            - Ensures that you give the right answer. For example, in this interview, she’s a junior. Is her question about how she can progress? About your leadership style?
    - We are not an agency. We’ve a consultancy. It doesn’t sound like much but it’s about how we brand and present ourselves.

    - Good follow ups on question #1.
    - Question #6: make sure that you contextualize the question around a **project decision** disagreement.
- June 27, 2024 - Luong Hoang Kim Chi
    
    
- July 12, 2024 - Doan Ngoc Vu Hong
    - Don’t hesitate to not answer vague questions such as “what challenges are you facing”
    - Same for “what projects are you working on.” You can always default to a general answer about the *type* of products and clients.
- July 19, 2024 - Manunchaya Boongthong (Teen)
    - q6: question should be more specific about a decision, not a project. The reason is to see how they handle individual disagreements (e.g., try to argument, disagree & commit, etc)
- August 29, 2024 - Tien Le
    - Good follow up on q1 about example of the bad manager’s behavior. Same for q10 on trying to guide her objectively through the question.
    - Don’t let candidates fuck with you with stupid questions. E.g., the 3 keywords BS. Answer what you feel can be a good answer.
    - Question about the career path: you can stick to a very basic answer, junior → mid-senior → senior. Beyond that is too far out of the picture for a candidate at this skills level.
    - Careful with the jokes. It’s fine in general but candidates with poor English may not get it.
- September 20, 2024 - Nguyen Tang Hong Nhat
    - Good jumping between questions based on context.
    - Good follow ups (e.g., about learning about and the importance of empathy → what’s a problem you solved through empathy).
    - Don’t be afraid of the blanks in the conversation, especially if the candidate is the one falling short (and even more so when it’s because they ask things they don’t understand). Let them figure out what they want.
