# Charles Gasche Interview

# Questions

## Executives Presentation

- Web can ship faster allowing faster iterations and experiments.
    - → Why ships faster?
    - → is the web usage high enough to draw solid conclusions?
- “Android release cycles are faster than iOS” → why?
- How do you manage customers’ frustration to see the new feature on a platform they don’t use?
- Team composition: ~~4 engineers, what stack?~~

## Backlog & Roadmap

- Why didn’t you use a backlog management tool or a Notion database?
- Sprints 3—4: backend implementation. Who’s working on what? What do the mobile Engineers do?

## Live Tracking

- Simulated Live Tracking (Map View) vs System Readiness for Real-time Data: aren’t you creating unnecessary complexity?

## PDPA

- Why a relationship with the consent *and* the consent version? Consent version should be enough.
- How would you retrieve consent status for a specific consent?
- “Actions required” won’t allow to target specific consents.
