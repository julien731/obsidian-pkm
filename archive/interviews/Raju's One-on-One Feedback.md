# Raju's One-on-One Feedback

## Good

- Likes working here.
- Learnt quite a bit about backlog management and grooming.
- Learnt more about the tools.
- Learnt how to use Pivotal.

## Frustrations

- Not going deep after product launch (e.g. analytics, user interviews). Not feeling like a product manager but more like a project manager.
- Still feels like he needs to be technically involved.

## Bad

- Too hectic with managing multiple projects.
- Planning on one project delays the others.
- Lacks control over the backlog on RP. Lots of ad-hoc requests.
    - RP should share their plans and timeline more.
    - RP needs an official process, documented. It's a problem.
- Developers need to be more involved with reviewing designs.
- Design sprint planning needs to be more organized, especially with 3rd PM coming.
- Took a pay cut to join the company. He was told that salary can be revisited after 3 months.
    - Not doing as good as before money-wise. Not saving enough. More money spent on rent. Unhappy about current salary.
