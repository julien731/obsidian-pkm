# Alice’s Inteview

- How do you believe a TA team should fit within the overall company structure? With which other areas do you see overlap and collaboration?
- As a lead, how would you approach reorganizing the TA structure within the company?
- Who do you see as your main stakeholders?

# Challenge

- It’s unclear the 5:1 metric, what is a submission? an offer?
- Check level of drive, comfort (she has been working in Finland/comfortable) to do things out of the ordinary/off office hours for example and how she will build her network in VN as she has been abroad for a while.

# Notes

- TA is similar to selling expect that we sell to people.
- Main stakeholders:
    - Hiring
    - HRBP
    - Marketing
    - Hiring managers
    - VPs of each groups to get the bigger picture of what the company is doing
    - Engineering managers
- “1:5 submissions”: 5 profiles sent from TA to the hiring manager.
