## CTO

Currently play the CTO role unofficially.

- Gathering requirements
- Preparing architecture
- Implementing with the team
- 6—7 people pretty standard as a Team Lead

## AI

- Got into it seriously about a month ago.
- Explain feature, get a plan out, iterate on the plan, go.
- Review the diff.

## Management vs. Execution

- Management work first.
- Ideal balance: 50/50. Likes to write code.

## Hands-on

- Loves writing code.

## First Steps

- Understand the product
- Understand the people
- State
- Goals
- Process
- After that can get to work
- A couple weeks of “discovery” before can start being efficient

## Engineering & Product

- Product bring ideas
- CTO translates into technical requirements with Product
- Tech team implements
- It’s always a conversation

## Working in a rush

- Rush = something’s wrong in the process.
- Requirements reduction. Focus on MVP.
- Rush leads to delivering a bad product.
- Some things should be negotiated, but not quality.

## General

- Not super clear in expressing his ideas.
