# Prakash Poudel Sharma

- Presentation
    - Exclusive access to top-rated delivery partners → what does that mean?
        - Very confusing answer.
    - Projected impact: what’s the timeframe? How will you measure it?
        - Another very confusing answer. He got lost.
    - How does each feature suggested address the problems and how will you measure their success?
        - He was, once again, lost.
        - Want to be differentiated from competitors so the features are to make the app different.
        - AI: UX-kind of metric (?). He just talked about location-based personalization.
        - Priority delivery: recurring orders.
        - Flexible subscription model: increase overall revenue
        - Exclusive chef collaboration: marketing.
        - Advanced order scheduling: new type of customers (e.g., office workers). Create loyal customers, massive increase in orders.
        - Eco-friendly packaging: increase older value (?)
- Do you normally manage backlogs in Google Docs?
    - He went through a long and windy explanation of how he shared high-level requirements with customers. It was very hard to follow. It also did not answer the question.
- Do you normally manage timelines in Google Docs?
    - He did not really answer the question. Talked about the fact that he usually does that in Google Sheets but no clarity about why he didn’t follow his process during the challenge.
- Order tracking
    - Overall you’re only giving high-level guidelines. Do you think it’s enough for a dev team to implement as per product expectations?
        - It’s a pattern. He does not answer questions. He just beats around the bush.
    - Why the need to save driver’s location while using the 3PL SDK to show the real-time location on the map?
        - He talked about “getting carried away” based on previous e-commerce projects.
    - How and when would you trigger notifications through OneSignal?
        - He talked about cross-platform vs. native solution for push notifications (?)
    - 3—4 months to implement the feature? That’s a lot.
- AI-powered meal recommendations
    - How would you build that?
    - What would engineers do for “setting up ML infra”, “developing recommendation algorithm”, “creating API endpoints”, etc?
- How would all the features would be prioritized?
- Misc
    - We need to double check his desire to get hands on.
    - We need to check his real interest in our company, we can disclose about the product we are building.
