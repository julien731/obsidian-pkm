# Ivan Alex Constantin’s Interview

## 🧪 Second Interview – Technical Product Manager

**Duration**: 60 minutes

**Interviewer**: Chief Product Officer

---

### 1. Introduction & Framing (5 min)

- Set the tone: This is a high-intensity, hands-on role. Everyone, regardless of level, is expected to execute.
- We’ll dig into mindset and technical depth.
- This is a two-way alignment — it’s as much for you to evaluate us as the other way around.

---

### 2. Ownership & Action Orientation (10–15 min)

- “What’s your approach when you spot a detail others missed but it’s not your ‘responsibility’?”
    - Listen for: bias for action, initiative, and boundaryless ownership
- Follow-up (optional):
    - “Tell me about a time you stepped into a situation that wasn’t going well — what did you do?”

---

### 3. Technical Depth & Hands-On Mindset (20–25 min)

- “Walk me through how you’d debug a failing integration with a third-party API.”
    - Listen for: structured thinking, tool familiarity, ability to isolate variables
- “What’s the last technical proof-of-concept you built yourself?”
    - Listen for: actual experience building, not just guiding; signs they enjoy diving in
- Optional follow-up:
    - “How do you validate the behavior of an API that lacks documentation?”
    - “What tools do you reach for when debugging unfamiliar systems?”

---

### 4. Culture & Values Fit (10–15 min)

- “What kind of environment brings out your best work?”
    - Listen for: alignment with high-ownership, no-handoff, bias-for-action cultures
- “What’s a value or behavior you will never compromise on?”
    - Listen for: clarity of personal principles, maturity, and self-awareness

---

### 5. Closing & Alignment Check (5 min)

- “Do you have any concerns about the hands-on intensity of the role?”
- Reinforce expectations: this isn’t a strategy-only role — you will need to execute.
