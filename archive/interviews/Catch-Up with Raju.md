# Catch-Up with Raju

# Topics

- Arriving late to the office on a regular basis ([[https://www.notion.so/nimblehq/Delays-5e2d8f53b962416f8b7a67c70e452da5]])
- Tactical decisions (i.e. impacting commercial  agreements) must be discussed and agreed upon internally first. You can't just propose to the client without approval.
    - For example, the idea of stopping MIA for 2 months and then resuming is not acceptable.
    - Having ideas is good, but they need to be discussed.
- With the reduced workload on MIA and RP, we will start involving Raju in The 1
    - Raju needs to experience bigger projects than just startups

# Notes

- When is the earliest we can resume Android dev for Braive?
