# Donald Saurin

- He conveys more stuff about what’s in it for him rather than the company.
    - First thing about “how can we reduce frustrations, how can we make you successful” → career growth
    - “Questions?” → are you doing hybrid?
- Presentation looks quite bad. Punctuation is completely off. No attention to details.
- Presentation was quite confusing. Very hard to follow (e.g., ”Identify” slide).
- He is not solution-oriented. He seems to just be selling websites, mobile apps, etc.
- Sharing sensitive information too easily (e.g., man-day rates from competitors).
