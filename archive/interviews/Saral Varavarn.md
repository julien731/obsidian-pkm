# Saral Varavarn

# Pros

- Very talkative.

# Cons

- His delivery is a bit robotic.
- He should have rewinded a bit when realized that his screen was not shared.
- Presentation looks quite poor.
- His questions were not at all covering the tech aspects.
- He did some research but it was extremely light (on the pet business) and irrelevant (research on the Venture Lead role on LinkedIn).
- He did not bounce back when the role play went south. It was very poorly handled.
