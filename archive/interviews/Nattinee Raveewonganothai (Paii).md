# Nattinee Raveewonganothai (Paii)

- Executive summary slide is super overloaded.
- Bundle services and Saas: good. Got insights from Rose? How?
- Revenue goals: 44M short-term and 57M long-term. How did you get those numbers?
- In-house product: how did you come up with the starting price? For which features?
- Introduce Nimble to the market and build a track record??
- Events: investment 500,000/event. To do what?
- Poor communication. Many typos in the presentation.
