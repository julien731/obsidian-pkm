Transcript

Because it's unclear for me, like, why Sunday...

When you say you you kept an eye on what happened after the rebranding basically, what what does that mean exactly?

So who planned and organized all of these kind of surveys and talking with some customers, showing them the app?

Are there any other things that you put in place, in addition to going out to talk with some customers and maybe some surveys with a few teams, are there any other things that you put in place to monitor the feedback to the rebranding?

Okay, and do some social media monitoring. What kind of tool do you use for that?

Okay, so you can like monitor each social account like one by one manually You can use any tool like Sprout or things like that, for example.

So, yeah, this is the report for the winning enterprise marketing strategy.

These letters might need a highly scalable, secure, and maintainable system.

So this is a thing that I have to research for a computer-less kid. This is because by partitioning...

So while some computers focus more on the affordable range and specialized offerings, never distinguish a sale by offering the comprehensive E2E service as a premium price point. So this is a gap of our expertise in holistic value that we really need.

Our pricing position is in the mid-to-high project, I guess. Yeah, so I'm with the significant... So here we delve deeper into our value delivery, the dominant segment. It shows that many players include nimble, prioritized, high-priced, and refreshing the E2E service code.

Our widespread positioning, or I would say the opportunity, I think we prioritise the comprehensive, inclusive partnership segment. That means offering holistic support, strategic guidance.

This also opens the opportunities that involve the compact and larger-scale development segment into getting strategic advice while maintaining competitive service quality. We can also effectively communicate and offer more QLED device, specialized offer for clients who need premium advertising in a specific area. How do you find out?

My graphic designer team has three birds and seven peas, so I kind of asked her, like, how expensive is it, to be honest. You're wearing the context, okay. Are you wearing the context or something like... Because it's like, it's their own self-perception, right? Yeah. I also do the research on...

To be honest, I also asked the AI to summarize as much as possible.

So I guess the 7P compared to what I have researched and the one that I have asked my I saw the news that they were combined with the... Deloitte.

Yeah I think about before I'm not sure how their position right so this is like when you are in the context of Because like, asking people, it can be very inaccurate. So I need to do this, I need to call, ask for like... Post as a potential customer and just ask like, okay, can you send me the red card or can you, so you need to talk to people, right? Not only talking to the employees because they're...

The graffiti designer doesn't have a red card. Yeah, it is. Right? So, like, it's a rumor. And for her, like... For him or her, like...

Each company never worked. I also have no friends.

I think in real life, if we work together to create a competitive landscape, we need to do that a lot more.

So we can use all of them to make it more accurate. The best way is just mystery shopping. Mystery shopping is the best way. Mystery shopping is just go to a client and just ask them, OK. Just use your personal email or like just make my Apple Pay, you know, just reach out to them. You can even buy code a website and just post as a potential customer.

My potential project, and you will get the tag. They present everything, so this is something that you buy.

I think we focus on co-government development. It's a lot of the client focus. We also offer an expert...

So, yeah, the key concept would be four things. The first one is executive engagement.

This is the key initiative that we will design for the student enterprise later in Bangkok. We are a single project. It is a long-term partnership. We will develop content and e-mail addresses.

We have to demonstrate things very clearly so that our service can lead the country.

We have a clear seven-step process from arranging alternatives to execution and optimisation. We define SLA as well. This includes defining target audience, content, channels, budget, and then moving to material preparation execution. It summarizes testimonials, industry insights, and the specific labor solutions that tailor to the city level.

The audience of each industry or target. And the link in the campaign as well to promote our events. The PR, the success story, and the industry-specific collateral. So, talking about the channel, our primary channel will be offline industry event conference.

The social media, especially LinkedIn and Facebook. And our SEO as well. And the website blog section too. Building the highest support for SEO. So, here is the Gating 20 overview for both APA and IMBA applications. We will employ the mix of outbound and inbound strategies across the customer journey from awareness stage to delight stage for fostering the lifetime value.

Start with the first step, the awareness. This is our core focus. So this involves an account-based marketing. And attending industry events or conferences, as I said before, we will ensure the brand consistency across all the categories.

We can change the social media and PR news to gain more liabilities and it's easier to close the deal when we talk to the authorities.

And another thing is the Linking Campaign because our key decision-makers are leaders in the environment.

I think this is one of the things that might have made the most effective. Did you see the linking campaign to promote the event with the F10?

So this kind of thing, I think we as content creators need to be aware of. And the senior management team as well to share on their own account to gain more credibility and viability as well. And I'm also thinking about the... 500 USD for PR production in the public. So this is kind of an update for the ABAP program.

Moving on to the inbound focus, abstract things, abstract states. Here we will regulate SEO and SEM. Our content ecosystem will be value-driven. We have to use industry-related keywords on our blog to increase the higher length of the essay. It will be good for our brand in the long run. We will have a strong SEO as well.

Yes, and this step, the key message and key conventionality will be focused immediately. The rest of the media channels will emphasize the key message. This thing I think about the E2E panel. It might be better if we have a short clip to summarize and go over our journey since they were a lot of videos.

The key success stories are easier to understand and make the prospects better. I understand much more and have a feeling to get it, why we have to prioritize the partnership a lot.

So, this thing, if we focus on the SEM as well, it might need to have a course

The next step is the end game stage, which is focused on the event and customization content.

We will personalize the journey with Twitter-based email notifications for the event, like pre-registers, Twitter highlights, or what not.

We will continue to promote the success story as well. This kind of thing, I think, since this day we focus on the event. And there's a lot of personalization.

The event hosting should include the networking session as well.

How do you get to that number? Because I have no development of my age. Oh, so that's what you... you pay $2,000 for... Can I get your hosted address? Yeah, I'd like to meet you twice a month. Yeah, but it depends. Actually, I'm not sure that because at right we posted it in our office.

The vision of Prospect for us is to encourage and generalize our sales and leadership team to give strategic approach to the Prospect target. We might use one page, tailor-made sales material and post-event content. For me, I'm not sure, but I think when we do it, I mean, nearly to close the deal, we may need to...

Is this something you also did at RISE? Like the brand new giveaways? The brand new giveaways, I did it at Sunday. What types of things did you guys give away?

Yeah, and the pen as well. It comes together.

It turns out that all this is about power resource, right? Which roles you can of course accept as self-representative of your budget, but I compose other roles, which ones do you need to act for? Actually, talking about the background is what I think.

The digital marketing specialist oversees all the campaigns and content creation. But if you don't have one, how would you manage? To be honest, I think when people cannot do it, or in the, you know. How much, how much effort and time do you think that you can save or?

By leveraging AI, for example. It's leveraging AI. Yeah, because like we're talking about here, all the content creation and copywriters say like you need to have like a copywriter and a digital marketing specialist. What can you get out of AI if you don't have these other people, because you say you mentioned like I think it's necessary, right? It's like how far can you get with using AI, for example?

Even we are a tech company, but we didn't use the AI to create that kind of vision. If we can do this, then we can do this.

Is there any specific industry event that you think would be very relevant for Nippon?

The website or application that might make the audience easier to understand. Okay, maybe the hospital, I mean, the hospital, like, can we do it, or...

They might have a lot of choices that their audience might enjoy.

I think that kind of complex website application thing might need more support. But is that a specific event, or what do you mean? I think that you're really misunderstanding. Yeah, yeah. So when you say in-stream events, right?

In Thai, we basically have the tech conference and we also have the... Which one? The journal specific, right? If I ask you, like, what colour is the duck? And you say, like, the duck has a colour.

Okay, so tell us some examples of the events that you attended when you were at South Dane that you learned.

At Sundays, you did that, right? Yes. Okay, which events do you go to at Sundays? As I mentioned... We went to HRTEC event. But this is once a year. Sorry? HRTEC is once a year, right? Yes. Doesn't they hold an event? HRTEC? There is an event called HRTEC.

What else? It has an HR tag, yes. Yeah. Wow, what else have you got? There's a B in it, but... Yes, there's one C in it. Yeah. Okay, I have the EGN stuff, I don't know about you. I'm not. He's doing it directly with you. Huh? EGL? EGL is now. Oh. I haven't sent you that, right? No, I have this already accepted with my calendar for 2 weeks, 3 weeks. Okay. So, I need to go. I'm not sure how late I can go to EGM.

No worries, we can continue.

Nimble needs anything to hang your hat on. What's our event? Something that could be good for us too.

Seven Peaks does something called a sundowner event. They do it every two weeks. That's kind of an in-house event. Yeah, in-house events. What can we do that's unique to Nimble? You said you were going to do two events a month, right? In-house? Yes. So what would those two events be? Okay, so this kind of thing, I'm thinking about to...

If we go in that way, the speaker might attack them. We have to understand the challenge and what they really need. And thinking about the agenda and content curation, my answer is yes.

And the networking thing as well. Because sometimes, when my explainers advise, sometimes they didn't want to listen to anything from the speaker. They just want to see someone who joins as well to make a partnership. So we should also have the networking session as well.

So that kind of thing that I think. I think we should do for the in-house event. But to answer the question, what kind of content, what kind of thing, I think it depends on where we go. If we go to the service way, I think it might be good, but it might not attract as many students as it should. My perspective is that we should go for the industry way.

It may make the audience feel more relatable.

In the Engage column, we talk about events here, we talk about speaker highlights. So the idea here is to have keynotes where speakers come and share about something.

So where would you find speakers?

But if it's a lower level, I maybe do not have to ask them, but to choose the ones I work really closely with. Because they may have the angles and they may know more. So basically when we join the international event, it's different. The event that we join, the event that we host. I'm talking about the event that we join. So basically we do the pre-event campaign.

You set up a coffee session at the industry event? Actually, at the event, they will provide a coffee session.

If anyone wants to catch up, or if there is any perspective, please let me know. I will DM them and tell them that there is an event on Sunday at 10pm. If you want to join, you can have a quick chat with our CEO. But we do need to pay for linking.

Do you have something great to share with the world? Sometimes I need it, I just don't want to pick up on it. So, do you have a secret recipe or do you know someone? The piano, right? I actually know...

I work very closely with the PR agency. I know them, but it's not for free. But if you want to copy on some...

We have to conduce them, even though we know them closely, but you know, I think we should put it for research.

Yeah, it's just not that much. What did you do for Sunday? We have... Use the PR agency? So you paid for it? Because, as I said, we do the PR for Sunday similarly to first phase of launching. So we didn't have a strong band that's why we need to pay for agency.

Yeah. But after that, 3 years later, After we have a chance to communicate with the publishers, some people we can ask them to do it for us. Sometimes we need to do the latter things. If we ask them to come in for a feed, we might have to put them on a website or something.

Do you have experience reaching out to websites and blogs about backlinking and stuff like this? My junior in the team is the one who executed it. But I have an explanation on that. Talking and buttering up other websites. They summoned for another hospitality because of the insurance rate. There is a lot of hospitality websites.

So to give you a quick glimpse, I think doing the website enhancement to refresh the key section for the

and make it reflect to our key ideas, key brand ideas.

It has been edited to include proper punctuation. It has been edited to include proper punctuation. To make the audience understand who we really are. At the Cleaning House Networking event as well, in the first event, we should... During the high promotion, you see the high-profile speakers to create an immediate buzz and attract the attendees. Because this can generate a high-quality list as well. So we might invest quite a lot in the first time of our in-house event. Yeah, if we're going to do this.

The next one is content communication. We will show the content plan. I will develop content assets based on the initial event theme.

We should achieve the top-of-mind status.

About who is the best e2e service provider, they may need to say it in Google. Yeah, that might be that kind of goal. Yes, and this can be measured by the target survey and qualitative quality.

It might build our brand even stronger. I think we should continuously expand our library in high-value content. The next is strategic partnership. We can explore the co-marketing, co-fostering opportunities with complementary organizations. It will explain the risks and feasibility and reduce the cost of hosting in-house or attending in-house events.

I think it's kind of the key thing for ASEAN to quickly and long-term manage.

In terms of strategic partnerships, do you have any kind of potential partner in mind that would be beneficial to work with?

There are a lot of PR identities that focus on the team.

We can also do the co-marketing with the tech investors.

Ask them to mention us on their clip or whatever. We can do that kind of thing as well. For the PR, the tech PR, we do have... I'm not sure the name of the PR agency that focuses on this company, but as far as I listened when I was working at S&A,

The event, yeah, that maybe... Senteng Group or the manufacturers that post for the inventory inside, inside, we can ask them to join for the... We can put our logo, or we can give them a giveaway to the audience when they do a style of thing. Can you go back to the time you had? Which one?

So, to execute this line, To get it off the ground, let's say we have no marketing in place to do this. How long would it take and how many people would work? It is that it's for me, right?

I think we can prioritize, you know, the first one, the JADV menu.

We do have some on-channel, right?

It is intended to be posted on our own channel first. May I ask, do we have the traffic in this channel? I mean, we have some care activities in LGS, but not dedicated for the marketing team per se. Ah, because we need to do this kind of work. It contains reports on the social media that we need to have some uproar to put on that.

So I think, if we can allocate manpower for designers,

Supporting me on the content. I can do the content, I can write it, but I still need some insight from the author as well. So I think it might be for one content, even one or two days.

It depends on the content of the dialogue. Or at least some help to do, is that what you're talking about? Yeah, content. Content. She can do content if she has the information, right? But while I still need the content, I feel it might be the first step I can implement.

So this right here, you got basically earmarked for 24 days, right? Yes. So with you and...

to be able to execute the plan. Right? Yes. I agree. Yes. Okay. Then, executing the plan, can you do all of that? Yes. Okay, so, I guess, the thing I'm trying to figure out here is how much manpower do we need if we hire you?

Like, initially. Initially. We have no marketing right now.

You must have that to start, or you can do without yourself. As a child, I am native to China.

I think it depends on the calendar and how many columns are there.

We do content a week. On Facebook, we do at least three posts a week. Are you doing different content for each of them? It's different because each type of channel will have a different pillar of the content.

The modem is the graphic designer.

For creating the content, I have someone who can review the inside of the content. So you need this information initially, right? That's what you're saying.

But honestly, I am not a coach in theater, so the quality of them, it might not...

I'm just trying to gauge this.

It requires other teams to support me as well in the strategies and from you guys to finalize the plan.

It made a lot of great teachers and educators. So this is lovely and you know, I'm fond of it.

Any other questions you have? No more questions for me. Do you have any questions?

We have internal capacity.

If you end up producing an enormous amount of content, at some point maybe it makes sense to have a dedicated one-man marketing team, right?

I don't think that's the point. It's more just to figure out.

End-to-end. I have an experience in a start-up. Cool. Yeah, yeah, so... Okay, any other questions? Hmm, for me, at the moment, no. Thank you so much for the presentation. I have one last. So, this whole plan, right? Have you seen anyone in the market?

Anyone in the market?

Doing something similar to what you're proposing here, from a branding or marketing perspective. Have you come across anyone?

Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.

Anyone you think competing with us would do something similar? Actually, I would show a 7P.

So they're actively looking for a paid solution, but we propose a fully paid solution.

At least there is a response now. It's not confusing. There, there. I'll show you.

No, it's the event, I think. This is also an event. So, I would say that I think they tried to do that kind of thought leadership content, but it's not consistent. So, I want to make it, I mean, for example, make it more consistent, make it like the inside library that everyone can rely on.
