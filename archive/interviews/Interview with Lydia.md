# Interview with Lydia

- POS competitors → are they really competing with what we do? They are not global.
- Competitors features table is not even translated.
- Lots of “I thing” and “maybe”.
- Monetization of QR ordering and CMS after free trial → “maybe” and no clear answer.
- Too many free trials and discounts.
- POS → 5,000—25,000 per quarter.
- QR ordering → 5,000 per month.
