# Arthur Barbaray’s Interview

# 1. Technical Depth & Execution Standards

- Tell me about a time you reviewed a project and decided to intervene. What triggered you? What did you do?

Answer:

- Lack of communication, delays, no demos, postponed demos.
- Jump in, see what happens.
- Get his hands dirty.

- What’s your personal bar for good code? How do you ensure your teams meet it — without blocking them?

Answer:

- Small funcons
- Testable
- Tested
    - Unit tests
    - Integration tests (main focus)
- Structured (i.e., no flat organization)

- How do you incorporate AI in your work?

Answer:

- Use for POCs
- Built a feature for invoice/receipt processing
- Writing tests (e.g., had to write 160 unit tests for a migration with just 2—3 days, the team said it was not possible, showed to them it can be done with AI)

## What to listen for:

- They get into specifics: code smells, anti-patterns, refactoring, observability, etc.
- They are comfortable jumping into complex issues, not just delegating.
- They talk about balancing velocity and quality realistically.

# 2. Proactive Technical Leadership

- How do you know a project is veering off course before anyone tells you?

Answer:

- Check technical metrics (burndown, specific performance KPIs)
- Check business metrics (i.e., OKR, does the work advance the business goals)

## What to listen for:

- Signals they track: failing builds, flaky tests, velocity drops, missed edge cases, etc.
- Tools they use: are you using any developers analytics platform (e.g., LinearB)?
- They inspect what’s happening, not just rely on status reports.

# 3. People & Manager of Managers

- When one of your managers is too soft on quality, how do you address it?

Answer:

- Hard. Not acceptable.

## What to listen for:

- Strong accountability culture with psychological safety.
- Comfort giving direct feedback to managers.
- Awareness of team signals: morale, retention, blind spots.

# 4. Pragmatism & Bias for Action

- Tell me about a time when you had to cut technical corners. How did you decide where and how to do it?

## What to listen for:

- Clear thinking about tradeoffs.
- Comfort making decisions with partial information.
- Not dogmatic — values momentum.

# 5. Wrap-Up and Role Reflection

- What attracts you to this role specifically?

Answer:

- Product-oriented approach
