# Phanuwat Wattanapraya (Boyd)’s Interview

- Work with internal stakeholders right?
- How do you learn the user journeys based on BRD? Collaboration with BA?
    - Do the BRDs cover all the flows?
- Who is part of the solutioning team? Just you?

# Notes

- Expected “perfect” requirements. If not can’t estimate.
    - Reject BRDs if not clear.
- SLAs: 15 days for complex, 22 days for very complex.
    - Very, very short.
- Seems to require a lot of support.
