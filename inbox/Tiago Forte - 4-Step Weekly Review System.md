# From Chaos to Clarity: My 4-Step Weekly Review System

**Author:** Tiago Forte
**Type:** YouTube Video

## Overview

Tiago Forte (author of "Building a Second Brain") shares his 4-step weekly review system designed to help transform weekly chaos into clarity and intentional focus.

## Key Concepts

A weekly review is a cornerstone habit of productivity systems like GTD (Getting Things Done). It typically involves:

1. **Capture** — Collecting loose ends and open loops
2. **Clarify** — Processing what each item means and what action is needed
3. **Organize** — Putting things in the right place
4. **Reflect** — Reviewing priorities and setting intentions for the week ahead

## Why Watch

- Learn a structured approach to weekly planning
- Reduce cognitive load from unprocessed tasks
- Gain clarity on priorities
- Start each week with intention rather than reaction
