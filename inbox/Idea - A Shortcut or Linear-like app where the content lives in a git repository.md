- Full context for LLM: codebase, docs, stories
- Still an interface for PMs to work from that's more pleasant
- North star: Linear
- What users can do:
	- Create modules
	- Create Features (a feature belongs to a module)
	- Create user stories (a story belongs to a feature)
	- Assign stories to people
	- View in Kanban view
		- Filter by module and feature
	- Move stories and features across states
- We could use Markdown with Frontmatter for managing relationships, status, metadata
