## Not Working Well
- I don't like the commits prefix
- Hard to follow Gitflow
	- Lower quality because of that; it's harder to review the code
- No writing tests baked into the workflow
- Although the docs live in the repo, they don't get updated
- When I add new stuff "on the fly" there is 0 tracking of it in any docs
## Working Well
- Research is good
- Planning is good
