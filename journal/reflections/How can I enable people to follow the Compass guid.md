- Set clear expectations
    - Company’s definition of success
    
    - Team’s definition of success
    - Role’s definition of success
- Where to find information about how to do things?
    - There shouldn’t be too many sources.
    - Could we index the Notion KB content into ES? That’d be a mighty powerful search tool.
- Principles instead of processes?
    - Analyze the Thoughtbot playbook.
    - Mix principles with processes?
        - Each process could have its own set of guiding principles (reasons for being).
        - The main guide could become the “master” list of principles. Processes are just a detailed view for “how to achieve those principles.”
        - Connect each role’s expectations to a set of principles.

## Some Principles Ideas

- Always provide the highest possible value to the client (relates to [Company’s definition of success](How%20can%20I%20enable%20people%20to%20follow%20the%20Compass%20guid%2084f9d546024741c493777ecc502c2414.md)).
- Always know the expectation for your work.
- Always plan ahead of time.
- Never leave something wrong unaddressed.
- ALways be clear with others about what you expect from them (corollary of [Always know the expectation for your work.](How%20can%20I%20enable%20people%20to%20follow%20the%20Compass%20guid%2084f9d546024741c493777ecc502c2414.md)).
