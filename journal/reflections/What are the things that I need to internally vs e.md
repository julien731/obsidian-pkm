- Before
    - Transition from sales to product
        - There is a disconnect. How do we bridge it better?
            - Explain from the start who they will be talking to: CEO → CPO → PM
                - It’s the natural cycle as we progressively involve more people
    - Expectations
        - During kickoff? A Google Slides?
        - Often clients don’t really get what’s next
    - Cheat sheet so that clients know all the important things
        - Point to where they can find information on Compass
