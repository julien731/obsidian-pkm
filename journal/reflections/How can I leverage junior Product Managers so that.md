# How can I leverage junior Product Managers so that they can learn and deliver value at the same time?

Open questions about structuring junior PM work to maximize both learning and output.

- What are the expectations?
    - Same skills, different levels of polish = same skills, different levels of output?
- How to supervise them properly?
- Should they lead client meetings?
- Very clear timelines and deadlines.
