# How can I make Project Managers more valuable in the team?

- Is it working to have Project Managers?
- Are they technical enough? With out technical approach, it’s important that everyone understand precisely what’s going on.
- Would assistant Product Managers be a better fit? If the work is just about chasing people and ensuring deadlines are met it’s not worth paying so high.
