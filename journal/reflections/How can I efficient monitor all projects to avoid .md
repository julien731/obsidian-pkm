# How can I efficient monitor all projects to avoid being reactive to problems when it's too late?

Reflection on building a project health monitoring system that identifies delays and risks before they become critical, balancing automated metrics with PM intuition.

- Measuring output (and not quality)
- Measuring progress
    - Quantifying backlog completeness
        - Define it by stage (like what we want to do with velocity expectations)?
- Metrics
    - Output
    - Trends (e.g., velocity, are things slowing down?)
- Simple, not complex. Just need a sign when it’s time to talk to the PM.
- Is there work in progress that shouldn’t be (e.g., not scheduled for the current sprint)?
- We should find a way to quantify each stage so that we can track an approximate progress. Not so much to know where we stand exactly, but to identify whether there is an obvious delay (e.g., exploration/design on Flexi Payroll)
- How much can we see from the data vs. the PM’s feelings and input?
- Can this process be really passive or does it need a routine check?
    - Automatic vs. manual → dashboard vs. reports
- Part of an active process. Discussing a project with the PM could start with “all the metrics look good, is there anything that wouldn’t show up on the reports?”

## The Big Questions

- Are we on time with the plan?
- Does the plan make sense?
- Can we foresee any risks?
- Is the client happy?
